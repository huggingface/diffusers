# Using Diffusers with other modalities

Diffusers is in the process of expanding to modalities other than images.

To try some of these in colab, please look at the following examples:
* [Molecule conformation generation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/geodiff_molecule_conformation.ipynb) ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg),
* [Model-based reinforcement learning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/reinforcement_learning_with_diffusers.ipynb) ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg),

Alternatively, the [`DanceDiffusionPipeline`] can be used to generate audio rapidly!
