# Philosophy

- Readability and clarity is prefered over highly optimized code. A strong importance is put on providing readable, intuitive and elementary code design. *E.g.*, the provided [schedulers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/schedulers) are separated from the provided [models](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/models) and provide well-commented code that can be read alongside the original paper.
- Lol
- Diffusers is **modality independent** and focusses on providing pretrained models and tools to build systems that generate **continous outputs**, *e.g.* vision and audio.
- Diffusion models and schedulers are provided as consise, elementary building blocks whereas diffusion pipelines are a collection of end-to-end diffusion systems that can be used out-of-the-box, should stay as close as possible to their original implementation and can include components of other library, such as text-encoders. Examples for diffusion pipelines are [Glide](https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im) and [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion).
