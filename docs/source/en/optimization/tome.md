# Token merging

[Token merging](https://huggingface.co/papers/2303.17604) (ToMe) merges redundant tokens/patches progressively in the forward pass of a Transformer-based network which can speed-up the inference latency of [`StableDiffusionPipeline`].

Install ToMe from `pip`:

```bash
pip install tomesd
```

You can use ToMe from the [`tomesd`](https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd) library with the [`apply_patch`](https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) function:

```diff
  from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
  import torch
  import tomesd

  pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
        "stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_safetensors=True,
  ).to("cuda")
+ tomesd.apply_patch(pipeline, ratio=0.5)

  image = pipeline("a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars").images[0]
```

The `apply_patch` function exposes a number of [arguments](https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd#usage) to help strike a balance between pipeline inference speed and the quality of the generated tokens. The most important argument is `ratio` which controls the number of tokens that are merged during the forward pass.

As reported in the [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2303.17604), ToMe can greatly preserve the quality of the generated images while boosting inference speed. By increasing the `ratio`, you can speed-up inference even further, but at the cost of some degraded image quality.

To test the quality of the generated images, we sampled a few prompts from [Parti Prompts](https://parti.research.google/) and performed inference with the [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] with the following settings:

<div class="flex justify-center">
      <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/diffusers/docs-images/resolve/main/tome/tome_samples.png">
</div>

We didnâ€™t notice any significant decrease in the quality of the generated samples, and you can check out the generated samples in this [WandB report](https://wandb.ai/sayakpaul/tomesd-results/runs/23j4bj3i?workspace=).

## Benchmarks

We also benchmarked the impact of `tomesd` on the [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] with [xFormers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/xformers) enabled across several image resolutions. The results are obtained from A100 and V100 GPUs in the following development environment:

```bash
- `diffusers` version: 0.15.1
- Python version: 3.8.16
- PyTorch version (GPU?): 1.13.1+cu116 (True)
- Huggingface_hub version: 0.13.2
- Transformers version: 4.27.2
- Accelerate version: 0.18.0
- xFormers version: 0.0.16
- tomesd version: 0.1.2
```

To reproduce this benchmark, feel free to use this [script](https://gist.github.com/sayakpaul/27aec6bca7eb7b0e0aa4112205850335). The results are reported in seconds, and where applicable we report the speed-up percentage over the vanilla pipeline when using ToMe and ToMe + xFormers.

As seen in the tables above, the speed-up from `tomesd` becomes more pronounced for larger image resolutions. It is also interesting to note that with `tomesd`, it is possible to run the pipeline on a higher resolution like 1024x1024. You may be able to speed-up inference even more with [`torch.compile`](fp16#torchcompile).
