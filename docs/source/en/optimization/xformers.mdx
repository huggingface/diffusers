# Installing xFormers

We recommend the use of [xFormers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) for both inference and training. In our tests, the optimizations performed in the attention blocks allow for both faster speed and reduced memory consumption.

Starting from version `0.0.16` of xFormers, released on January 2023, installation can be easily performed using pre-built pip wheels:

```bash
pip install xformers
```

<Tip>

The xFormers PIP package requires the latest version of PyTorch (1.13.1 as of xFormers 0.0.16). If you need to use a previous version of PyTorch, then we recommend you install xFormers from source using [the project instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers#installing-xformers).

</Tip>

After xFormers is installed, you can use `enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()` for faster inference and reduced memory consumption, as discussed [here](fp16#memory-efficient-attention).
