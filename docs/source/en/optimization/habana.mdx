# How to use Stable Diffusion on Habana Gaudi

🤗 Diffusers is compatible with Habana Gaudi through 🤗 [Optimum Habana](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/usage_guides/stable_diffusion).

## Requirements

- Optimum Habana 1.3 or later, [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/installation) is how to install it.
- SynapseAI 1.7.


## Inference Pipeline

To generate images with Stable Diffusion 1 and 2 on Gaudi, you need to instantiate two instances:
- A pipeline with [`GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/stable_diffusion_pipeline). This pipeline supports *text-to-image generation*.
- A scheduler with [`GaudiDDIMScheduler`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/stable_diffusion_pipeline#optimum.habana.diffusers.GaudiDDIMScheduler). This scheduler has been optimized for Habana Gaudi.

When initializing the pipeline, you have to specify `use_habana=True` to deploy it on HPUs.
Furthermore, in order to get the fastest possible generations you should enable **HPU graphs** with `use_hpu_graphs=True`.
Finally, you will need to specify a [Gaudi configuration](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/gaudi_config) which can be downloaded from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Habana).

```python
from optimum.habana import GaudiConfig
from optimum.habana.diffusers import GaudiDDIMScheduler, GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline

model_name = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base"
scheduler = GaudiDDIMScheduler.from_pretrained(model_name, subfolder="scheduler")
pipeline = GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    scheduler=scheduler,
    use_habana=True,
    use_hpu_graphs=True,
    gaudi_config="Habana/stable-diffusion",
)
```

You can then call the pipeline to generate images by batches from one or several prompts:
```python
outputs = pipeline(
    prompt=[
        "High quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse in space",
        "Face of a yellow cat, high resolution, sitting on a park bench",
    ],
    num_images_per_prompt=10,
    batch_size=4,
)
```

For more information, check out Optimum Habana's [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/usage_guides/stable_diffusion) and the [example](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/stable-diffusion) provided in the official Github repository.


## Benchmark

Here are the latencies for Habana Gaudi 1 and Gaudi 2 with the [Habana/stable-diffusion](https://huggingface.co/Habana/stable-diffusion) Gaudi configuration (mixed precision bf16/fp32):

|         | Latency | Batch size |
| ------- |:-------:|:----------:|
| Gaudi 1 | 4.37s   | 4/8        |
| Gaudi 2 | 1.19s   | 4/8        |
