# OpenVINO

ðŸ¤— [Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) provides Stable Diffusion pipelines compatible with OpenVINO to perform inference on a variety of Intel processors (see the [full list](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_Supported_Devices.html) of supported devices).

You'll need to install ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel with the `--upgrade-strategy eager` option to ensure [`optimum-intel`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) is using the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum["openvino"]
```

This guide will show you how to use the Stable Diffusion and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) pipelines with OpenVINO.

## Stable Diffusion

To load and run inference, use the [`~optimum.intel.OVStableDiffusionPipeline`]. If you want to load a PyTorch model and convert it to the OpenVINO format on-the-fly, set `export=True`:

```python
from optimum.intel import OVStableDiffusionPipeline

model_id = "stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
pipeline = OVStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, export=True)
prompt = "sailing ship in storm by Rembrandt"
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]

# Don't forget to save the exported model
pipeline.save_pretrained("openvino-sd-v1-5")
```

To further speed-up inference, statically reshape the model. If you change any parameters such as the outputs height or width, youâ€™ll need to statically reshape your model again.

```python
# Define the shapes related to the inputs and desired outputs
batch_size, num_images, height, width = 1, 1, 512, 512

# Statically reshape the model
pipeline.reshape(batch_size, height, width, num_images)
# Compile the model before inference
pipeline.compile()

image = pipeline(
    prompt,
    height=height,
    width=width,
    num_images_per_prompt=num_images,
).images[0]
```

</div>

You can find more examples in the ðŸ¤— Optimum [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference#stable-diffusion), and Stable Diffusion is supported for text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting.

## Stable Diffusion XL

To load and run inference with SDXL, use the [`~optimum.intel.OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline`]:

```python
from optimum.intel import OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline

model_id = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
pipeline = OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id)
prompt = "sailing ship in storm by Rembrandt"
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
```

To further speed-up inference, [statically reshape](#stable-diffusion) the model as shown in the Stable Diffusion section.

You can find more examples in the ðŸ¤— Optimum [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference#stable-diffusion-xl), and running SDXL in OpenVINO is supported for text-to-image and image-to-image.
