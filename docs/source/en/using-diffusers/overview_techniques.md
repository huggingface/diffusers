# Overview

The inference pipeline supports and enables a wide range of techniques that are divided into two categories:

* Pipeline functionality: these techniques modify the pipeline or extend it for other applications. For example, pipeline callbacks add new features to a pipeline and a pipeline can also be extended for distributed inference.
* Improve inference quality: these techniques increase the visual quality of the generated images. For example, you can enhance your prompts with GPT2 to create better images with lower effort.
