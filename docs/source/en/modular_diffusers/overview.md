# Getting Started with Modular Diffusers

<Tip warning={true}>

ðŸ§ª **Experimental Feature**: Modular Diffusers is an experimental feature we are actively developing. The API may be subject to breaking changes.

</Tip>

With Modular Diffusers, we introduce a unified pipeline system that simplifies how you work with diffusion models. Instead of creating separate pipelines for each task, Modular Diffusers lets you:

**Write Only What's New**: You won't need to write an entire pipeline from scratch every time you have a new use case. You can create pipeline blocks just for your new workflow's unique aspects and reuse existing blocks for existing functionalities. 

**Assemble Like LEGOÂ®**: You can mix and match between blocks in flexible ways. This allows you to write dedicated blocks unique to specific workflows, and then assemble different blocks into a pipeline that can be used more conveniently for multiple workflows. 


Here's how our guides are organized to help you navigate the Modular Diffusers documentation:

### ðŸš€ Running Pipelines
- **[Modular Pipeline Guide](./modular_pipeline.md)** - How to use predefined blocks to build a pipeline and run it
- **[Components Manager Guide](./components_manager.md)** - How to manage and reuse components across multiple pipelines

### ðŸ“š Creating PipelineBlocks
- **[Pipeline and Block States](./modular_diffusers_states.md)** - Understanding PipelineState and BlockState
- **[Pipeline Block](./pipeline_block.md)** - How to write custom PipelineBlocks
- **[SequentialPipelineBlocks](sequential_pipeline_blocks.md)** - Connecting blocks in sequence
- **[LoopSequentialPipelineBlocks](./loop_sequential_pipeline_blocks.md)** - Creating iterative workflows
- **[AutoPipelineBlocks](./auto_pipeline_blocks.md)** - Conditional block selection

### ðŸŽ¯ Practical Examples
- **[End-to-End Example](./end_to_end_guide.md)** - Complete end-to-end examples including sharing your workflow in huggingface hub and deplying UI nodes
