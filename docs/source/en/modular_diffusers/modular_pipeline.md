# ModularPipeline

<Tip warning={true}>

ðŸ§ª **Experimental Feature**: Modular Diffusers is an experimental feature we are actively developing. The API may be subject to breaking changes.

</Tip>

`ModularPipeline` is the main interface for end users to run pipelines in Modular Diffusers. It takes pipeline blocks and converts them into a runnable pipeline that can load models and execute the computation steps.

In this guide, we will focus on how to build pipelines using the blocks we officially support at diffusers ðŸ§¨. We'll cover how to use predefined blocks and convert them into a `ModularPipeline` for execution.

<Tip>

This guide shows you how to use predefined blocks. If you want to learn how to create your own pipeline blocks, see the [PipelineBlock guide](pipeline_block.md) for creating individual blocks, and the multi-block guides for connecting them together:
- [SequentialPipelineBlocks](sequential_pipeline_blocks.md) (for linear workflows)
- [LoopSequentialPipelineBlocks](loop_sequential_pipeline_blocks.md) (for iterative workflows)  
- [AutoPipelineBlocks](auto_pipeline_blocks.md) (for conditional workflows)

For information on how data flows through pipelines, see the [PipelineState and BlockState guide](modular_diffusers_states.md).

</Tip>


## Create ModularPipelineBlocks

In Modular Diffusers system, you build pipelines using Pipeline blocks. Pipeline Blocks are fundamental building blocks - they define what components, inputs/outputs, and computation logics are needed. They are designed to be assembled into workflows for tasks such as image generation, video creation, and inpainting. But they are just definitions and don't actually run anything. To execute blocks, you need to put them into a `ModularPipeline`. We'll first learn how to create predefined blocks here before talking about how to run them using `ModularPipeline`. 

All pipeline blocks inherit from the base class `ModularPipelineBlocks`, including:

- [`PipelineBlock`]: The most granular block - you define the input/output/components requirements and computation logic.
- [`SequentialPipelineBlocks`]: A multi-block composed of multiple blocks that run sequentially, passing outputs as inputs to the next block.
- [`LoopSequentialPipelineBlocks`]: A special type of `SequentialPipelineBlocks` that runs the same sequence of blocks multiple times (loops), typically used for iterative processes like denoising steps in diffusion models.
- [`AutoPipelineBlocks`]: A multi-block composed of multiple blocks that are selected at runtime based on the inputs.

It is very easy to use a `ModularPipelineBlocks` officially supported in ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

```py
from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import StableDiffusionXLTextEncoderStep

text_encoder_block = StableDiffusionXLTextEncoderStep()
```

This is a single `PipelineBlock`. You'll see that this text encoder block uses 2 text_encoders, 2 tokenizers as well as a guider component. It takes user inputs such as `prompt` and `negative_prompt`, and return text embeddings outputs such as `prompt_embeds` and `negative_prompt_embeds`.

```py
>>> text_encoder_block
StableDiffusionXLTextEncoderStep(
  Class: PipelineBlock
  Description: Text Encoder step that generate text_embeddings to guide the image generation
    Components:
        text_encoder (`CLIPTextModel`)
        text_encoder_2 (`CLIPTextModelWithProjection`)
        tokenizer (`CLIPTokenizer`)
        tokenizer_2 (`CLIPTokenizer`)
        guider (`ClassifierFreeGuidance`)
    Configs:
        force_zeros_for_empty_prompt (default: True)
  Inputs:
    prompt=None, prompt_2=None, negative_prompt=None, negative_prompt_2=None, cross_attention_kwargs=None, clip_skip=None
  Intermediates:
    - outputs: prompt_embeds, negative_prompt_embeds, pooled_prompt_embeds, negative_pooled_prompt_embeds
)
```

More commonly, you need multiple blocks to build your workflow. You can create a `SequentialPipelineBlocks` using block class presets from ðŸ§¨ Diffusers. `TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS` is a dict containing all the blocks needed for text-to-image generation.

```py
from diffusers.modular_pipelines import SequentialPipelineBlocks
from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS
t2i_blocks = SequentialPipelineBlocks.from_blocks_dict(TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS)
```

This creates a `SequentialPipelineBlocks`. Unlike the `text_encoder_block` we saw earlier, this is a multi-block and its `sub_blocks` attribute contains a list of other blocks (text_encoder, input, set_timesteps, prepare_latents, prepare_added_con, denoise, decode). Its requirements for components, inputs, and intermediate inputs are combined from these blocks that compose it. At runtime, it executes its sub-blocks sequentially and passes the pipeline state from one block to another. 

```py
>>> t2i_blocks
SequentialPipelineBlocks(
  Class: ModularPipelineBlocks

  Description: 


  Components:
      text_encoder (`CLIPTextModel`)
      text_encoder_2 (`CLIPTextModelWithProjection`)
      tokenizer (`CLIPTokenizer`)
      tokenizer_2 (`CLIPTokenizer`)
      guider (`ClassifierFreeGuidance`)
      scheduler (`EulerDiscreteScheduler`)
      unet (`UNet2DConditionModel`)
      vae (`AutoencoderKL`)
      image_processor (`VaeImageProcessor`)

  Configs:
      force_zeros_for_empty_prompt (default: True)

  Sub-Blocks:
    [0] text_encoder (StableDiffusionXLTextEncoderStep)
       Description: Text Encoder step that generate text_embeddings to guide the image generation

    [1] input (StableDiffusionXLInputStep)
       Description: Input processing step that:
                     1. Determines `batch_size` and `dtype` based on `prompt_embeds`
                     2. Adjusts input tensor shapes based on `batch_size` (number of prompts) and `num_images_per_prompt`
                   
                   All input tensors are expected to have either batch_size=1 or match the batch_size
                   of prompt_embeds. The tensors will be duplicated across the batch dimension to
                   have a final batch_size of batch_size * num_images_per_prompt.

    [2] set_timesteps (StableDiffusionXLSetTimestepsStep)
       Description: Step that sets the scheduler's timesteps for inference

    [3] prepare_latents (StableDiffusionXLPrepareLatentsStep)
       Description: Prepare latents step that prepares the latents for the text-to-image generation process

    [4] prepare_add_cond (StableDiffusionXLPrepareAdditionalConditioningStep)
       Description: Step that prepares the additional conditioning for the text-to-image generation process

    [5] denoise (StableDiffusionXLDenoiseStep)
       Description: Denoise step that iteratively denoise the latents. 
                   Its loop logic is defined in `StableDiffusionXLDenoiseLoopWrapper.__call__` method 
                   At each iteration, it runs blocks defined in `sub_blocks` sequencially:
                    - `StableDiffusionXLLoopBeforeDenoiser`
                    - `StableDiffusionXLLoopDenoiser`
                    - `StableDiffusionXLLoopAfterDenoiser`
                   This block supports both text2img and img2img tasks.

    [6] decode (StableDiffusionXLDecodeStep)
       Description: Step that decodes the denoised latents into images

)
```

This is the block classes preset (`TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS`) we used: It is just a dictionary that maps names to ModularPipelineBlocks classes

```py
>>> TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS
InsertableDict([
  0: ('text_encoder', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.encoders.StableDiffusionXLTextEncoderStep'>),
  1: ('input', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLInputStep'>),
  2: ('set_timesteps', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLSetTimestepsStep'>),
  3: ('prepare_latents', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLPrepareLatentsStep'>),
  4: ('prepare_add_cond', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLPrepareAdditionalConditioningStep'>),
  5: ('denoise', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.denoise.StableDiffusionXLDenoiseLoop'>),
  6: ('decode', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.decoders.StableDiffusionXLDecodeStep'>)
])
```

When we create a `SequentialPipelineBlocks` from this preset, it instantiates each block class into actual block objects. Its `sub_blocks` attribute now contains these instantiated objects:

```py
>>> t2i_blocks.sub_blocks
InsertableDict([
  0: ('text_encoder', <obj 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.encoders.StableDiffusionXLTextEncoderStep'>),
  1: ('input', <obj 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLInputStep'>),
  2: ('set_timesteps', <obj 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLSetTimestepsStep'>),
  3: ('prepare_latents', <obj 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLPrepareLatentsStep'>),
  4: ('prepare_add_cond', <obj 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.before_denoise.StableDiffusionXLPrepareAdditionalConditioningStep'>),
  5: ('denoise', <obj 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.denoise.StableDiffusionXLDenoiseStep'>),
  6: ('decode', <obj 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.decoders.StableDiffusionXLDecodeStep'>)
])
```

Note that both the block classes preset and the `sub_blocks` attribute are `InsertableDict` objects. This is a custom dictionary that extends `OrderedDict` with the ability to insert items at specific positions. You can perform all standard dictionary operations (get, set, delete) plus insert items at any index, which is particularly useful for reordering or inserting blocks in the middle of a pipeline.

**Add a block:**
```py
# BLOCKS is dict of block classes, you need to add class to it
BLOCKS.insert("block_name", BlockClass, index)
# sub_blocks attribute contains instance, add a block instance to the  attribute
t2i_blocks.sub_blocks.insert("block_name", block_instance, index)
```

**Remove a block:**
```py
# remove a block class from preset
BLOCKS.pop("text_encoder")
# split out a block instance on its own
text_encoder_block = t2i_blocks.sub_blocks.pop("text_encoder")
```

**Swap block:**
```py
# Replace block class in preset
BLOCKS["prepare_latents"] = CustomPrepareLatents
# Replace in sub_blocks attribute using an block instance
t2i_blocks.sub_blocks["prepare_latents"] = CustomPrepareLatents()
```

This means you can mix-and-match blocks in very flexible ways. Let's see some real examples:

**Example 1: Adding IP-Adapter to the Block Classes Preset**
Let's make a new block classes preset by insert IP-Adapter at index 0 (before the text_encoder block), and create a text-to-image pipeline with IP-Adapter support:

```py
from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import StableDiffusionXLAutoIPAdapterStep
CUSTOM_BLOCKS = TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS.copy()
# CUSTOM_BLOCKS is now a preset including ip_adapter
CUSTOM_BLOCKS.insert("ip_adapter", StableDiffusionXLAutoIPAdapterStep, 0)
# create a blocks isntance from the preset
custom_blocks = SequentialPipelineBlocks.from_blocks_dict(CUSTOM_BLOCKS)
```

**Example 2: Extracting a block from a multi-block**
You can extract a block instance from the multi-block to use it independently. A common pattern is to use text_encoder to process prompts once, then reuse the text embeddings outputs to generate multiple images with different settings (schedulers, seeds, inference steps). We can do this by simply extracting the text_encoder block from the pipeline.

```py
# this gives you StableDiffusionXLTextEncoderStep()
>>> text_encoder_blocks = t2i_blocks.sub_blocks.pop("text_encoder")
>>> text_encoder_blocks
```

The multi-block now has fewer components and no longer has the `text_encoder` block. If you check its docstring `t2i_blocks.doc`, you will see that it no longer accepts `prompt` as input - you will need to pass the embeddings instead.

```py
>>> t2i_blocks
SequentialPipelineBlocks(
  Class: ModularPipelineBlocks

  Description: 

  Components:
      scheduler (`EulerDiscreteScheduler`)
      guider (`ClassifierFreeGuidance`)
      unet (`UNet2DConditionModel`)
      vae (`AutoencoderKL`)
      image_processor (`VaeImageProcessor`)

  Blocks:
    [0] input (StableDiffusionXLInputStep)
       Description: Input processing step that:
                     1. Determines `batch_size` and `dtype` based on `prompt_embeds`
                     2. Adjusts input tensor shapes based on `batch_size` (number of prompts) and `num_images_per_prompt`
                   
                   All input tensors are expected to have either batch_size=1 or match the batch_size
                   of prompt_embeds. The tensors will be duplicated across the batch dimension to
                   have a final batch_size of batch_size * num_images_per_prompt.

    [1] set_timesteps (StableDiffusionXLSetTimestepsStep)
       Description: Step that sets the scheduler's timesteps for inference

    [2] prepare_latents (StableDiffusionXLPrepareLatentsStep)
       Description: Prepare latents step that prepares the latents for the text-to-image generation process

    [3] prepare_add_cond (StableDiffusionXLPrepareAdditionalConditioningStep)
       Description: Step that prepares the additional conditioning for the text-to-image generation process

    [4] denoise (StableDiffusionXLDenoiseLoop)
       Description: Denoise step that iteratively denoise the latents. 
                   Its loop logic is defined in `StableDiffusionXLDenoiseLoopWrapper.__call__` method 
                   At each iteration, it runs blocks defined in `blocks` sequencially:
                    - `StableDiffusionXLLoopBeforeDenoiser`
                    - `StableDiffusionXLLoopDenoiser`
                    - `StableDiffusionXLLoopAfterDenoiser`
                   

    [5] decode (StableDiffusionXLDecodeStep)
       Description: Step that decodes the denoised latents into images

)
```

<Tip>

ðŸ’¡ You can find all the block classes presets we support for each model in `ALL_BLOCKS`.

```py
# For Stable Diffusion XL
from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import ALL_BLOCKS
ALL_BLOCKS
# For other models...
from diffusers.modular_pipelines.<model_name> import ALL_BLOCKS
```

Each model provides a dictionary that maps all supported tasks/techniques to their corresponding block classes presets. For SDXL, it is 

```py
ALL_BLOCKS = {
    "text2img": TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS,
    "img2img": IMAGE2IMAGE_BLOCKS,
    "inpaint": INPAINT_BLOCKS,
    "controlnet": CONTROLNET_BLOCKS,
    "ip_adapter": IP_ADAPTER_BLOCKS,
    "auto": AUTO_BLOCKS,
}
```

</Tip>

This covers the essentials of pipeline blocks! Like we have already mentioned, **pipeline blocks are not runnable by themselves**. They are essentially **"definitions"** - they define the specifications and computational steps for a pipeline, but they do not contain any model states. To actually run them, you need to convert them into a `ModularPipeline` object.


## Modular Repo

To convert blocks into a runnable pipeline, you may need a repository if your blocks contain **pretrained components** (models with checkpoints that need to be loaded from the Hub). Pipeline blocks define what components they need (like a UNet, text encoder, etc.), as well as how to create them: components can be either created using **from_pretrained** method (with checkpoints) or **from_config** (initialized from scratch with default configuration, usually stateless like a guider or scheduler). 

If your pipeline contains **pretrained components**, you typically need to use a repository to provide the loading specifications and metadata.

`ModularPipeline` works specifically with modular repositories, which offer more flexibility in component loading compared to traditional repositories. You can find an example modular repo [here](https://huggingface.co/YiYiXu/modular-diffdiff).

A `DiffusionPipeline` defines `model_index.json` to configure its components. However, repositories for Modular Diffusers work with `modular_model_index.json`. Let's walk through the differences here.

In standard `model_index.json`, each component entry is a `(library, class)` tuple:
```py
"text_encoder": [
  "transformers",
  "CLIPTextModel"
],
```

In `modular_model_index.json`, each component entry contains 3 elements: `(library, class, loading_specs_dict)`

- `library` and `class`: Information about the actual component loaded in the pipeline at the time of saving (will be `null` if not loaded)
- `loading_specs_dict`: A dictionary containing all information required to load this component, including `repo`, `revision`, `subfolder`, `variant`, and `type_hint`. 

```py
"text_encoder": [
  null,  # library of actual loaded component (same as in model_index.json)
  null,  # class of actual loaded componenet (same as in model_index.json)
  {      # loading specs map (unique to modular_model_index.json)
    "repo": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",  # can be a different repo
    "revision": null,
    "subfolder": "text_encoder",
    "type_hint": [  # (library, class) for the expected component
      "transformers",  
      "CLIPTextModel"
    ],
    "variant": null
  }
],
```

Unlike standard repositories where components must be in subfolders within the same repo, modular repositories can fetch components from different repositories based on the `loading_specs_dict`. e.g. the `text_encoder` component will be fetched from the "text_encoder" folder in `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` while other components come from different repositories.


## Creating a `ModularPipeline` from `ModularPipelineBlocks`

Each `ModularPipelineBlocks` has an `init_pipeline` method that can initialize a `ModularPipeline` object based on its component and configuration specifications.

Let's convert our `t2i_blocks` (which we created earlier) into a runnable `ModularPipeline`. We'll use a `ComponentsManager` to handle device placement, memory management, and component reuse automatically:

```py
# We already have this from earlier
t2i_blocks = SequentialPipelineBlocks.from_blocks_dict(TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS)

# Now convert it to a ModularPipeline
from diffusers import ComponentsManager
modular_repo_id = "YiYiXu/modular-loader-t2i-0704"
components = ComponentsManager()
t2i_pipeline = t2i_blocks.init_pipeline(modular_repo_id, components_manager=components)
```

<Tip>

ðŸ’¡ **ComponentsManager** is the model registry and management system in diffusers, it track all the models in one place and let you add, remove and reuse them across different workflows in most efficient way. Without it, you'd need to manually manage GPU memory, device placement, and component sharing between workflows. See the [Components Manager guide](components_manager.md) for detailed information.

</Tip>

The `init_pipeline()` method creates a ModularPipeline and loads component specifications from the repository's `modular_model_index.json` file, but doesn't load the actual models yet.


## Creating a `ModularPipeline` with `from_pretrained`

You can create a `ModularPipeline` from a HuggingFace Hub repository with `from_pretrained` method, as long as it's a modular repo:

```py
from diffusers import ModularPipeline, ComponentsManager
components = ComponentsManager()
pipeline = ModularPipeline.from_pretrained("YiYiXu/modular-loader-t2i-0704", components_manager=components)
```

Loading custom code is also supported:

```py
from diffusers import ModularPipeline, ComponentsManager
components = ComponentsManager()
modular_repo_id = "YiYiXu/modular-diffdiff-0704"
diffdiff_pipeline = ModularPipeline.from_pretrained(modular_repo_id, trust_remote_code=True, components_manager=components)
```

This modular repository contains custom code. The folder contains these files:

```
modular-diffdiff-0704/
â”œâ”€â”€ block.py                    # Custom pipeline blocks implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json                 # Pipeline configuration and auto_map
â””â”€â”€ modular_model_index.json    # Component loading specifications
```

The [`config.json`](https://huggingface.co/YiYiXu/modular-diffdiff-0704/blob/main/config.json) file defines a custom `DiffDiffBlocks` class and points to its implementation:

```json
{
  "_class_name": "DiffDiffBlocks",
  "auto_map": {
    "ModularPipelineBlocks": "block.DiffDiffBlocks"
  }
}
```

The `auto_map` tells the pipeline where to find the custom blocks definition - in this case, it's looking for `DiffDiffBlocks` in the `block.py` file. The actual `DiffDiffBlocks` class is defined in [`block.py`](https://huggingface.co/YiYiXu/modular-diffdiff-0704/blob/main/block.py) within the repository.

When `diffdiff_pipeline.blocks` is created, it's based on the `DiffDiffBlocks` definition from the custom code in the repository, allowing you to use specialized blocks that aren't part of the standard diffusers library.

## Loading components into a `ModularPipeline`

Unlike `DiffusionPipeline`, when you create a `ModularPipeline` instance (whether using `from_pretrained` or converting from pipeline blocks), its components aren't loaded automatically. You need to explicitly load model components using `load_default_components` or `load_components(names=..,)`:

```py
# This will load ALL the expected components into pipeline
import torch
t2i_pipeline.load_default_components(torch_dtype=torch.float16)
t2i_pipeline.to("cuda")
```

All expected components are now loaded into the pipeline. You can also partially load specific components using the `names` argument. For example, to only load unet and vae:

```py
>>> t2i_pipeline.load_components(names=["unet", "vae"], torch_dtype=torch.float16)
```

You can inspect the pipeline's loading status by simply printing the pipeline itself. It helps you understand what components are expected to load, which ones are already loaded, how they were loaded, and what loading specs are available. Let's print out the `t2i_pipeline`:

```py
>>> t2i_pipeline
StableDiffusionXLModularPipeline {
  "_blocks_class_name": "SequentialPipelineBlocks",
  "_class_name": "StableDiffusionXLModularPipeline",
  "_diffusers_version": "0.35.0.dev0",

      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": "scheduler",
      "type_hint": [
        "diffusers",
        "EulerDiscreteScheduler"
      ],
      "variant": null
    }
  ],
  "text_encoder": [
    null,
    null,
    {

      "subfolder": "text_encoder",
      "type_hint": [

      ],
      "variant": null
    }
  ],
  "text_encoder_2": [
    null,
    null,
    {
      "repo": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": "text_encoder_2",
      "type_hint": [
        "transformers",
        "CLIPTextModelWithProjection"
      ],
      "variant": null
    }
  ],
  "tokenizer": [
    null,
    null,
    {
      "repo": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": "tokenizer",
      "type_hint": [
        "transformers",
        "CLIPTokenizer"
      ],
      "variant": null
    }
  ],
  "tokenizer_2": [

    null,
    {
      "repo": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": "tokenizer_2",
      "type_hint": [
        "transformers",
        "CLIPTokenizer"
      ],
      "variant": null
    }
  ],
  "unet": [
    "diffusers",
    "UNet2DConditionModel",
    {
      "repo": "RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v9",
      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": "unet",
      "type_hint": [
        "diffusers",
        "UNet2DConditionModel"
      ],
      "variant": "fp16"
    }
  ],
  "vae": [
    "diffusers",
    "AutoencoderKL",
    {
      "repo": "madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix",
      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": null,
      "type_hint": [
        "diffusers",
        "AutoencoderKL"
      ],
      "variant": null
    }
  ]
}
```

You can see all the **pretrained components** that will be loaded using `from_pretrained` method are listed as entries. Each entry contains 3 elements: `(library, class, loading_specs_dict)`:

- **`library` and `class`**: Show the actual loaded component info. If `null`, the component is not loaded yet.
- **`loading_specs_dict`**: Contains all the information needed to load the component (repo, subfolder, variant, etc.)

In this example:
- **Loaded components**: `vae` and `unet` (their `library` and `class` fields show the actual loaded models)
- **Not loaded yet**: `scheduler`, `text_encoder`, `text_encoder_2`, `tokenizer`, `tokenizer_2` (their `library` and `class` fields are `null`, but you can see their loading specs to know where they'll be loaded from when you call `load_components()`)

You're looking at essentailly the pipeline's config dict that's synced with the `modular_model_index.json` from the repository you used during `init_pipeline()` - it takes the loading specs that match the pipeline's component requirements.

For example, if your pipeline needs a `text_encoder` component, it will include the loading spec for `text_encoder` from the modular repo during the `init_pipeline`. If the pipeline doesn't need a component (like `controlnet` in a basic text-to-image pipeline), that component won't be included even if it exists in the modular repo.

There are also a few properties that can provide a quick summary of component loading status: 

```py
# All components expected by the pipeline
>>> t2i_pipeline.component_names
['text_encoder', 'text_encoder_2', 'tokenizer', 'tokenizer_2', 'guider', 'scheduler', 'unet', 'vae', 'image_processor']

# Components that are not loaded yet (will be loaded with from_pretrained)
>>> t2i_pipeline.null_component_names
['text_encoder', 'text_encoder_2', 'tokenizer', 'tokenizer_2', 'scheduler']

# Components that will be loaded from pretrained models
>>> t2i_pipeline.pretrained_component_names
['text_encoder', 'text_encoder_2', 'tokenizer', 'tokenizer_2', 'scheduler', 'unet', 'vae']

# Components that are created with default config (no repo needed)
>>> t2i_pipeline.config_component_names
['guider', 'image_processor']
```

From config components (like `guider` and `image_processor`) are not included in the pipeline output above because they don't need loading specs - they're already initialized during pipeline creation. You can see this because they're not listed in `null_component_names`.

## Modifying Loading Specs

When you call `pipeline.load_components(names=)` or `pipeline.load_default_components()`, it uses the loading specs from the modular repository's `modular_model_index.json`. You can change where components are loaded from by modifying the `modular_model_index.json` in the repository. Just find the file on the Hub and click edit - you can change any field in the loading specs: `repo`, `subfolder`, `variant`, `revision`, etc.

```py
# Original spec in modular_model_index.json
"unet": [
  null, null,
  {
    "repo": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    "subfolder": "unet",
    "variant": "fp16"
  }
]

# Modified spec - changed repo, subfolder, and variant
"unet": [
  null, null,
  {
    "repo": "RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v9",
    "subfolder": "unet", 
    "variant": "fp16"
  }
]
```

Now if you create a pipeline using the same blocks and updated repository, it will by default load from the new repository.

```py
pipeline = ModularPipeline.from_pretrained("YiYiXu/modular-loader-t2i-0704", components_manager=components)
pipeline.load_components(names="unet")
```


## Updating components in a `ModularPipeline`

Similar to `DiffusionPipeline`, you can load components separately to replace the default ones in the pipeline. In Modular Diffusers, the approach depends on the component type:

- **Pretrained components** (`default_creation_method='from_pretrained'`): Must use `ComponentSpec` to load them to update the existing one.
- **Config components** (`default_creation_method='from_config'`): These are components that don't need loading specs - they're created during pipeline initialization with default config. To update them, you can either pass the object directly or pass a ComponentSpec directly.

<Tip>

ðŸ’¡ **Component Type Changes**: The component type (pretrained vs config-based) can change when you update components. These types are initially defined in pipeline blocks' `expected_components` field using `ComponentSpec` with `default_creation_method`. See the [Customizing Guidance Techniques](#customizing-guidance-techniques) section for examples of how this works in practice.

</Tip>

`ComponentSpec` defines how to create or load components and can actually create them using its `create()` method (for ConfigMixin objects) or `load()` method (wrapper around `from_pretrained()`). When a component is loaded with a ComponentSpec, it gets tagged with a unique ID that encodes its creation parameters, allowing you to always extract the original specification using `ComponentSpec.from_component()`.

Now let's look at how to update pretrained components in practice:

So instead of 

```py
from diffusers import UNet2DConditionModel
import torch
unet = UNet2DConditionModel.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", subfolder="unet", variant="fp16", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
```
You should load your model like this

```py
from diffusers import ComponentSpec, UNet2DConditionModel
unet_spec = ComponentSpec(name="unet",type_hint=UNet2DConditionModel, repo="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", subfolder="unet", variant="fp16")
unet2 = unet_spec.load(torch_dtype=torch.float16)
```

The key difference is that the second unet retains its loading specs, so you can extract the spec and recreate the unet:

```py
# component -> spec
>>> spec = ComponentSpec.from_component("unet", unet2)
>>> spec
ComponentSpec(name='unet', type_hint=<class 'diffusers.models.unets.unet_2d_condition.UNet2DConditionModel'>, description=None, config=None, repo='stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0', subfolder='unet', variant='fp16', revision=None, default_creation_method='from_pretrained')
# spec -> component
>>> unet2_recreatd = spec.load(torch_dtype=torch.float16)
```

To replace the unet in the pipeline

```
t2i_pipeline.update_components(unet=unet2)
```

Not only is the `unet` component swapped, but its loading specs are also updated from "RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v9" to "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0" in pipeline config. This means that if you save the pipeline now and load it back with `from_pretrained`, the new pipeline will by default load the SDXL original unet.

```
>>> t2i_pipeline
StableDiffusionXLModularPipeline {
  ...
  "unet": [
    "diffusers",
    "UNet2DConditionModel",
    {
      "repo": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": "unet",
      "type_hint": [
        "diffusers",
        "UNet2DConditionModel"
      ],
      "variant": "fp16"
    }
  ],
  ...
}  
```
<Tip>

ðŸ’¡ **Modifying Component Specs**: You can get a copy of the current component spec from the pipeline using `get_component_spec()`. This makes it easy to modify the spec and updating components.

```py
>>> unet_spec = t2i_pipeline.get_component_spec("unet")
>>> unet_spec
ComponentSpec(
    name='unet', 
    type_hint=<class 'diffusers.models.unets.unet_2d_condition.UNet2DConditionModel'>, 
    repo='RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v9', 
    subfolder='unet', 
    variant='fp16', 
    default_creation_method='from_pretrained'
)

# Modify the spec to load from a different repository
>>> unet_spec.repo = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"

# Load the component with the modified spec
>>> unet = unet_spec.load(torch_dtype=torch.float16)
```

</Tip>

## Customizing Guidance Techniques

Guiders are implementations of different [classifier-free guidance](https://huggingface.co/papers/2207.12598) techniques that can be applied during the denoising process to improve generation quality, control, and adherence to prompts. They work by steering the model predictions towards desired directions and away from undesired directions. In diffusers, guiders are implemented as subclasses of `BaseGuidance`. They can easily be integrated into modular pipelines and provide a flexible way to enhance generation quality without modifying the underlying diffusion models.

**ClassifierFreeGuidance (CFG)** is the first and most common guidance technique, used in all our standard pipelines. We also offer many other guidance techniques from the latest research in this area - **PerturbedAttentionGuidance (PAG)**, **SkipLayerGuidance (SLG)**, **SmoothedEnergyGuidance (SEG)**, and others that can provide better results for specific use cases.

This section demonstrates how to use guiders using the component updating methods we just learned. Since `BaseGuidance` components are stateless (similar to schedulers), they are typically created with default configurations during pipeline initialization using `default_creation_method='from_config'`. This means they don't require loading specs from the repository - you won't see guider listed in `modular_model_index.json` files.

Let's take a look at the default guider configuration:

```py
>>> t2i_pipeline.get_component_spec("guider")
ComponentSpec(name='guider', type_hint=<class 'diffusers.guiders.classifier_free_guidance.ClassifierFreeGuidance'>, description=None, config=FrozenDict([('guidance_scale', 7.5), ('guidance_rescale', 0.0), ('use_original_formulation', False), ('start', 0.0), ('stop', 1.0), ('_use_default_values', ['start', 'guidance_rescale', 'stop', 'use_original_formulation'])]), repo=None, subfolder=None, variant=None, revision=None, default_creation_method='from_config')
```

As you can see, the guider is configured to use `ClassifierFreeGuidance` with default parameters and `default_creation_method='from_config'`, meaning it's created during pipeline initialization rather than loaded from a repository. Let's verify this, here we run `init_pipeline()` without a modular repo, and there it is, a guider with the default configuration we just saw


```py
>>> pipeline = t2i_blocks.init_pipeline()
>>> pipeline.guider
ClassifierFreeGuidance {
  "_class_name": "ClassifierFreeGuidance",
  "_diffusers_version": "0.35.0.dev0",
  "guidance_rescale": 0.0,
  "guidance_scale": 7.5,
  "start": 0.0,
  "stop": 1.0,
  "use_original_formulation": false
}
```

#### Modify Parameters of the Same Guider Type

To change parameters of the same guider type (e.g., adjusting the `guidance_scale` for CFG), you have two options:

**Option 1: Use ComponentSpec.create() method**

You just need to pass the parameter with the new value to override the default one.

```python
>>> guider_spec = t2i_pipeline.get_component_spec("guider")
>>> guider = guider_spec.create(guidance_scale=10)
>>> t2i_pipeline.update_components(guider=guider)
```

**Option 2: Pass ComponentSpec directly**

Update the spec directly and pass it to `update_components()`.

```python
>>> guider_spec = t2i_pipeline.get_component_spec("guider")
>>> guider_spec.config["guidance_scale"] = 10
>>> t2i_pipeline.update_components(guider=guider_spec)
```

Both approaches produce the same result:
```python
>>> t2i_pipeline.guider
ClassifierFreeGuidance {
  "_class_name": "ClassifierFreeGuidance",
  "_diffusers_version": "0.35.0.dev0",
  "guidance_rescale": 0.0,
  "guidance_scale": 10,
  "start": 0.0,
  "stop": 1.0,
  "use_original_formulation": false
}
```

#### Switch to a Different Guider Type

Switching between guidance techniques is as simple as passing a guider object of that technique:

```py
from diffusers import LayerSkipConfig, PerturbedAttentionGuidance
config = LayerSkipConfig(indices=[2, 9], fqn="mid_block.attentions.0.transformer_blocks", skip_attention=False, skip_attention_scores=True, skip_ff=False)
guider = PerturbedAttentionGuidance(
    guidance_scale=5.0, perturbed_guidance_scale=2.5, perturbed_guidance_config=config
)
t2i_pipeline.update_components(guider=guider)
```

Note that you will get a warning about changing the guider type, which is expected:

```
ModularPipeline.update_components: adding guider with new type: PerturbedAttentionGuidance, previous type: ClassifierFreeGuidance
```

<Tip>

- For `from_config` components (like guiders, schedulers): You can pass an object of required type OR pass a ComponentSpec directly (which calls `create()` under the hood)
- For `from_pretrained` components (like models): You must use ComponentSpec to ensure proper tagging and loading

</Tip>

Let's verify that the guider has been updated:

```py
>>> t2i_pipeline.guider
PerturbedAttentionGuidance {
  "_class_name": "PerturbedAttentionGuidance",
  "_diffusers_version": "0.35.0.dev0",
  "guidance_rescale": 0.0,
  "guidance_scale": 5.0,
  "perturbed_guidance_config": {
    "dropout": 1.0,
    "fqn": "mid_block.attentions.0.transformer_blocks",
    "indices": [
      2,
      9
    ],
    "skip_attention": false,
    "skip_attention_scores": true,
    "skip_ff": false
  },
  "perturbed_guidance_layers": null,
  "perturbed_guidance_scale": 2.5,
  "perturbed_guidance_start": 0.01,
  "perturbed_guidance_stop": 0.2,
  "start": 0.0,
  "stop": 1.0,
  "use_original_formulation": false
}

```

The component spec has also been updated to reflect the new guider type:

```py
>>> t2i_pipeline.get_component_spec("guider")
ComponentSpec(name='guider', type_hint=<class 'diffusers.guiders.perturbed_attention_guidance.PerturbedAttentionGuidance'>, description=None, config=FrozenDict([('guidance_scale', 5.0), ('perturbed_guidance_scale', 2.5), ('perturbed_guidance_start', 0.01), ('perturbed_guidance_stop', 0.2), ('perturbed_guidance_layers', None), ('perturbed_guidance_config', LayerSkipConfig(indices=[2, 9], fqn='mid_block.attentions.0.transformer_blocks', skip_attention=False, skip_attention_scores=True, skip_ff=False, dropout=1.0)), ('guidance_rescale', 0.0), ('use_original_formulation', False), ('start', 0.0), ('stop', 1.0), ('_use_default_values', ['perturbed_guidance_start', 'use_original_formulation', 'perturbed_guidance_layers', 'stop', 'start', 'guidance_rescale', 'perturbed_guidance_stop']), ('_class_name', 'PerturbedAttentionGuidance'), ('_diffusers_version', '0.35.0.dev0')]), repo=None, subfolder=None, variant=None, revision=None, default_creation_method='from_config')
```

The "guider" is still a `from_config` component: is still not included in the pipeline config and will not be saved into the `modular_model_index.json`.

```py
>>> assert "guider" not in  t2i_pipeline.config
```

However, you can change it to a `from_pretrained` component, which allows you to upload your customized guider to the Hub and load it into your pipeline.

#### Loading Custom Guiders from Hub

If you already have a guider saved on the Hub and a `modular_model_index.json` with the loading spec for that guider, it will automatically be changed to a `from_pretrained` component during pipeline initialization.

For example, this `modular_model_index.json` includes loading specs for the guider:

```json
{
  "guider": [
    null,
    null,
    {
      "repo": "YiYiXu/modular-loader-t2i-guider",
      "revision": null,
      "subfolder": "pag_guider",
      "type_hint": [
        "diffusers",
        "PerturbedAttentionGuidance"
      ],
      "variant": null
    }
  ]
}
```

When you use this repository to create a pipeline with the same blocks (that originally configured guider as a `from_config` component), the guider becomes a `from_pretrained` component. This means it doesn't get created during initialization, and after you call `load_default_components()`, it loads based on the spec - resulting in the PAG guider instead of the default CFG.

```py
t2i_pipeline = t2i_blocks.init_pipeline("YiYiXu/modular-doc-guider")
assert t2i_pipeline.guider is None  # Not created during init
t2i_pipeline.load_default_components()
t2i_pipeline.guider  # Now loaded as PAG guider
```

#### Upload Custom Guider to Hub for Easy Loading & Sharing

Now let's see how we can share the guider on the Hub and change it to a `from_pretrained` component.

```py
guider.push_to_hub("YiYiXu/modular-loader-t2i-guider", subfolder="pag_guider")
```

VoilÃ ! Now you have a subfolder called `pag_guider` on that repository. 

You have a few options to make this guider available in your pipeline:

1. **Directly modify the `modular_model_index.json`** to add a loading spec for the guider by pointing to a folder containing the desired guider config.

2. **Use the `update_components` method** to change it to a `from_pretrained` component for your pipeline. This is easier if you just want to try it out with different repositories.

Let's use the second approach and change our guider_spec to use `from_pretrained` as the default creation method and update the loading spec to use this subfolder we just created:

```python
guider_spec = t2i_pipeline.get_component_spec("guider")
guider_spec.default_creation_method="from_pretrained"
guider_spec.repo="YiYiXu/modular-loader-t2i-guider"
guider_spec.subfolder="pag_guider"
pag_guider = guider_spec.load()
t2i_pipeline.update_components(guider=pag_guider)
```

You will get a warning about changing the creation method:

```
ModularPipeline.update_components: changing the default_creation_method of guider from from_config to from_pretrained.
```

Now not only the `guider` component and its component_spec are updated, but so is the pipeline config.

If you want to change the default behavior for future pipelines, you can push the updated pipeline to the Hub. This way, when others use your repository, they'll get the PAG guider by default. However, this is optional - you don't have to do this if you just want to experiment locally.

```py
t2i_pipeline.push_to_hub("YiYiXu/modular-doc-guider")
```


<Tip>

Experiment with different techniques and parameters to find what works best for your specific use case! You can find all the guider class we support [here](TODO: API doc)

Additionally, you can write your own guider implementations, for example, CFG Zero* combined with Skip Layer Guidance, and they should be compatible out-of-the-box with modular diffusers!

</Tip>

## Running a `ModularPipeline`

The API to run the `ModularPipeline` is very similar to how you would run a regular `DiffusionPipeline`:

```py
>>> image = pipeline(prompt="a cat", num_inference_steps=15, output="images")[0]
```

There are a few key differences though:
1. You can also pass a `PipelineState` object directly to the pipeline instead of individual arguments
2. If you do not specify the `output` argument, it returns the `PipelineState` object
3. You can pass a list as `output`, e.g. `pipeline(... output=["images", "latents"])` will return a dictionary containing both the generated image and the final denoised latents

Under the hood, `ModularPipeline`'s `__call__` method is a wrapper around the pipeline blocks' `__call__` method: it creates a `PipelineState` object and populates it with user inputs, then returns the output to the user based on the `output` argument. It also ensures that all pipeline-level config and components are exposed to all pipeline blocks by preparing and passing a `components` input.

<Tip>

You can inspect the docstring of a `ModularPipeline` to check what arguments the pipeline accepts and how to specify the `output` you want. It will list all available outputs (basically everything in the intermediate pipeline state) so you can choose from the list.

```py
t2i_pipeline.doc
```

**Important**: It is important to always check the docstring because arguments can be different from standard pipelines that you're familar with. For example, in Modular Diffusers we standardized controlnet image input as `control_image`, but regular pipelines have inconsistencies over the names, e.g. controlnet text-to-image uses `image` while SDXL controlnet img2img uses `control_image`.

**Note**: The `output` list might be longer than you expected - it includes everything in the intermediate state that you can choose to return. Most of the time, you'll just want `output="images"` or `output="latents"`.

</Tip>

#### Text-to-Image, Image-to-Image, and Inpainting

These are minimum inference examples for basic tasks: text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting. The process to create different pipelines is the same - only difference is the block classes presets. The inference is also more or less same to standard pipelines, but please always check `.doc` for correct input names and remember to pass `output="images"`.

#### ControlNet

For ControlNet, we provide one auto block you can place at the `denoise` step. Let's create it and inspect it to see what it tells us. 

<Tip>

ðŸ’¡ **How to explore new tasks**: When you want to figure out how to do a specific task in Modular Diffusers, it is a good idea to start by checking what block classes presets we offer in `ALL_BLOCKS`. Then create the block instance and inspect it - it will show you the required components, description, and sub-blocks. This is crucial for understanding what each block does and what it needs.

</Tip>

```py
>>> from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import ALL_BLOCKS
>>> ALL_BLOCKS["controlnet"]
InsertableDict([
  0: ('denoise', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.modular_blocks.StableDiffusionXLAutoControlnetStep'>)
])
>>> controlnet_blocks = ALL_BLOCKS["controlnet"]["denoise"]()
>>> controlnet_blocks
StableDiffusionXLAutoControlnetStep(
  Class: SequentialPipelineBlocks

  ====================================================================================================
  This pipeline contains blocks that are selected at runtime based on inputs.
  Trigger Inputs: {'mask', 'control_mode', 'control_image', 'controlnet_cond'}
  Use `get_execution_blocks()` with input names to see selected blocks (e.g. `get_execution_blocks('mask')`).
  ====================================================================================================


  Description: Controlnet auto step that prepare the controlnet input and denoise the latents. It works for both controlnet and controlnet_union and supports text2img, img2img and inpainting tasks. (it should be replace at 'denoise' step)


  Components:
      controlnet (`ControlNetUnionModel`)
      control_image_processor (`VaeImageProcessor`)
      scheduler (`EulerDiscreteScheduler`)
      unet (`UNet2DConditionModel`)
      guider (`ClassifierFreeGuidance`)

  Sub-Blocks:
    [0] controlnet_input (StableDiffusionXLAutoControlNetInputStep)
       Description: Controlnet Input step that prepare the controlnet input.
                   This is an auto pipeline block that works for both controlnet and controlnet_union.
                    (it should be called right before the denoise step) - `StableDiffusionXLControlNetUnionInputStep` is called to prepare the controlnet input when `control_mode` and `control_image` are provided.
                    - `StableDiffusionXLControlNetInputStep` is called to prepare the controlnet input when `control_image` is provided. - if neither `control_mode` nor `control_image` is provided, step will be skipped.

    [1] controlnet_denoise (StableDiffusionXLAutoControlNetDenoiseStep)
       Description: Denoise step that iteratively denoise the latents with controlnet. This is a auto pipeline block that using controlnet for text2img, img2img and inpainting tasks.This block should not be used without a controlnet_cond input - `StableDiffusionXLInpaintControlNetDenoiseStep` (inpaint_controlnet_denoise) is used when mask is provided. - `StableDiffusionXLControlNetDenoiseStep` (controlnet_denoise) is used when mask is not provided but controlnet_cond is provided. - If neither mask nor controlnet_cond are provided, step will be skipped.

)
```

<Tip>

ðŸ’¡ **Auto Blocks**: This is first time we meet a Auto Blocks! `AutoPipelineBlocks` automatically adapt to your inputs by combining multiple workflows with conditional logic. This is why one convenient block can work for all tasks and controlnet types. See the [Auto Blocks Guide](./auto_pipeline_blocks.md) for more details.

</Tip>

The block shows us it has two steps (prepare inputs + denoise) and supports all tasks with both controlnet and controlnet union. Most importantly, it tells us to place it at the 'denoise' step. Let's do exactly that:

```py
import torch
from diffusers.modular_pipelines import SequentialPipelineBlocks
from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS, StableDiffusionXLAutoControlnetStep
from diffusers.utils import load_image

# create pipeline from blocks preset
blocks = SequentialPipelineBlocks.from_blocks_dict(TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS)

# these two lines applies controlnet
controlnet_blocks = StableDiffusionXLAutoControlnetStep()
blocks.sub_blocks["denoise"] = controlnet_blocks 
```

Before we convert the blocks into a pipeline and load its components, let's inspect the blocks and its docs again to make sure it was assembled correctly. You should be able to see that `controlnet` and `control_image_processor` are now listed as `Components`, so we should initialize the pipeline with a repo that contains desired loading specs for these 2 components.

```py
# make sure to a modular_repo including controlnet
modular_repo_id = "YiYiXu/modular-demo-auto"
pipeline = blocks.init_pipeline(modular_repo_id)
pipeline.load_default_components(torch_dtype=torch.float16)

#### IP-Adapter

**Challenge time!** Before we show you how to apply IP-adapter, try doing it yourself! Use the same process we just walked you through with ControlNet: check the official blocks preset, inspect the block instance and docstring `.doc`, and adapt a regular IP-adapter example to modular.

Let's walk through the steps:

1. Check blocks preset

```py
>>> from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import ALL_BLOCKS
>>> ALL_BLOCKS["ip_adapter"]
InsertableDict([
  0: ('ip_adapter', <class 'diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl.modular_blocks.StableDiffusionXLAutoIPAdapterStep'>)
])
```

2. inspect the block & doc

```
>>> from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import StableDiffusionXLAutoIPAdapterStep
>>> ip_adapter_blocks = StableDiffusionXLAutoIPAdapterStep()
>>> ip_adapter_blocks
StableDiffusionXLAutoIPAdapterStep(
  Class: AutoPipelineBlocks

  ====================================================================================================
  This pipeline contains blocks that are selected at runtime based on inputs.
  Trigger Inputs: {'ip_adapter_image'}
  Use `get_execution_blocks()` with input names to see selected blocks (e.g. `get_execution_blocks('ip_adapter_image')`).
  ====================================================================================================


  Description: Run IP Adapter step if `ip_adapter_image` is provided. This step should be placed before the 'input' step.
      


  Components:
      image_encoder (`CLIPVisionModelWithProjection`)
      feature_extractor (`CLIPImageProcessor`)
      unet (`UNet2DConditionModel`)
      guider (`ClassifierFreeGuidance`)

  Sub-Blocks:
    â€¢ ip_adapter [trigger: ip_adapter_image] (StableDiffusionXLIPAdapterStep)
       Description: IP Adapter step that prepares ip adapter image embeddings.
                   Note that this step only prepares the embeddings - in order for it to work correctly, you need to load ip adapter weights into unet via ModularPipeline.load_ip_adapter() and pipeline.set_ip_adapter_scale().
                   See [ModularIPAdapterMixin](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/loaders/ip_adapter#diffusers.loaders.ModularIPAdapterMixin) for more details

)
```
3. follow the instruction to build

```py
import torch
from diffusers.modular_pipelines import SequentialPipelineBlocks
from diffusers.modular_pipelines.stable_diffusion_xl import TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS

# create pipeline from official blocks preset
blocks = SequentialPipelineBlocks.from_blocks_dict(TEXT2IMAGE_BLOCKS)

# insert ip_adapter_blocks before the input step as instructed
blocks.sub_blocks.insert("ip_adapter", ip_adapter_blocks, 1)

# inspec the blocks before you convert it into pipelines,
# and make sure to use a repo that contains the loading spec for all components
# for ip-adapter, you need image_encoder & feature_extractor
modular_repo_id = "YiYiXu/modular-demo-auto"
pipeline = blocks.init_pipeline(modular_repo_id)

pipeline.load_default_components(torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipeline.load_ip_adapter(
  "h94/IP-Adapter",
  subfolder="sdxl_models",
  weight_name="ip-adapter_sdxl.bin"
)
pipeline.set_ip_adapter_scale(0.8)
pipeline.to("cuda")
```

4. adapt an example to modular

We are using [this one](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/ip_adapter?ipadapter-variants=IP-Adapter+Plus#ip-adapter) from our IP-Adapter doc!


```py
from diffusers.utils import load_image
image = load_image("https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/ip_adapter_diner.png")
image = pipeline(
    prompt="a polar bear sitting in a chair drinking a milkshake",
    ip_adapter_image=image,
    negative_prompt="deformed, ugly, wrong proportion, low res, bad anatomy, worst quality, low quality",
    output="images"
)[0]
image.save("modular_ipa_out.png")
```
