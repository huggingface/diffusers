# Overview

Welcome to ðŸ§¨ Diffusers! If you're new to diffusion models and generative AI, and want to learn more, then you've come to the right place. These beginner-friendly tutorials are designed to provide a gentle introduction to diffusion models and help you understand the library fundamentals - the core components and how ðŸ§¨ Diffusers is meant to be used.

You'll learn how to use a pipeline for inference to rapidly generate things, and then deconstruct that pipeline to really understand how to use the library as a modular toolbox for building your own diffusion systems. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to train your own diffusion model to generate what you want.

After completing the tutorials, you'll have gained the necessary skills to start exploring the library on your own and see how to use it for your own projects and applications.
