# HeunDiscreteScheduler

The Heun scheduler (Algorithm 1) is from the [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.00364) paper by Karras et al. The scheduler is ported from the [k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion) library and created by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/).
