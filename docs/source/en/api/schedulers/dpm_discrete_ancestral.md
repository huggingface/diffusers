# KDPM2AncestralDiscreteScheduler

The `KDPM2DiscreteScheduler` with ancestral sampling is inspired by the [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.00364) paper, and the scheduler is ported from and created by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/).

The original codebase can be found at [crowsonkb/k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion).
