# DPMSolverMultistepInverse

`DPMSolverMultistepInverse` is the inverted scheduler from [DPM-Solver: A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.00927) and [DPM-Solver++: Fast Solver for Guided Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2211.01095) by Cheng Lu, Yuhao Zhou, Fan Bao, Jianfei Chen, Chongxuan Li, and Jun Zhu.

The implementation is mostly based on the DDIM inversion definition of [Null-text Inversion for Editing Real Images using Guided Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2211.09794) and notebook implementation of the [`DiffEdit`] latent inversion from [Xiang-cd/DiffEdit-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/Xiang-cd/DiffEdit-stable-diffusion/blob/main/diffedit.ipynb).

## Tips

Dynamic thresholding from [Imagen](https://huggingface.co/papers/2205.11487) is supported, and for pixel-space
diffusion models, you can set both `algorithm_type="dpmsolver++"` and `thresholding=True` to use the dynamic
thresholding. This thresholding method is unsuitable for latent-space diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion.
