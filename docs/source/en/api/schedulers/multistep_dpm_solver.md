# DPMSolverMultistepScheduler

`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler` is a multistep scheduler from [DPM-Solver: A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.00927) and [DPM-Solver++: Fast Solver for Guided Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2211.01095) by Cheng Lu, Yuhao Zhou, Fan Bao, Jianfei Chen, Chongxuan Li, and Jun Zhu.

DPMSolver (and the improved version DPMSolver++) is a fast dedicated high-order solver for diffusion ODEs with convergence order guarantee. Empirically, DPMSolver sampling with only 20 steps can generate high-quality
samples, and it can generate quite good samples even in 10 steps.

## Tips

It is recommended to set `solver_order` to 2 for guide sampling, and `solver_order=3` for unconditional sampling.

Dynamic thresholding from [Imagen](https://huggingface.co/papers/2205.11487) is supported, and for pixel-space
diffusion models, you can set both `algorithm_type="dpmsolver++"` and `thresholding=True` to use the dynamic
thresholding. This thresholding method is unsuitable for latent-space diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion.

The SDE variant of DPMSolver and DPM-Solver++ is also supported, but only for the first and second-order solvers. This is a fast SDE solver for the reverse diffusion SDE. It is recommended to use the second-order `sde-dpmsolver++`.
