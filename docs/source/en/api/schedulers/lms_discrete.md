# LMSDiscreteScheduler

`LMSDiscreteScheduler` is a linear multistep scheduler for discrete beta schedules. The scheduler is ported from and created by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/), and the original implementation can be found at [crowsonkb/k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion/blob/481677d114f6ea445aa009cf5bd7a9cdee909e47/k_diffusion/sampling.py#L181).
