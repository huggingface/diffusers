# KarrasVeScheduler

`KarrasVeScheduler` is a stochastic sampler tailored to variance-expanding (VE) models. It is based on the [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.00364) and [Score-based generative modeling through stochastic differential equations](https://huggingface.co/papers/2011.13456) papers.
