# PNDMScheduler

`PNDMScheduler`, or pseudo numerical methods for diffusion models, uses more advanced ODE integration techniques like the Runge-Kutta and linear multi-step method. The original implementation can be found at [crowsonkb/k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion/blob/481677d114f6ea445aa009cf5bd7a9cdee909e47/k_diffusion/sampling.py#L181).
