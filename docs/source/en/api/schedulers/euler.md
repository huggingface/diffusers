# EulerDiscreteScheduler

The Euler scheduler (Algorithm 2) is from the [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.00364) paper by Karras et al. This is a fast scheduler which can often generate good outputs in 20-30 steps. The scheduler is based on the original [k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion/blob/481677d114f6ea445aa009cf5bd7a9cdee909e47/k_diffusion/sampling.py#L51) implementation by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/).
