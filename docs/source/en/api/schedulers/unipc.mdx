# UniPC

## Overview

UniPC is a training-free framework designed for the fast sampling of diffusion models, which consists of a corrector (UniC) and a predictor (UniP) that share a unified analytical form and support arbitrary orders.

For more details about the method, please refer to the [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04867) and the [[code]](https://github.com/wl-zhao/UniPC).
