# IP-Adapter

[IP-Adapter](https://hf.co/papers/2308.06721) is a lightweight adapter that enables prompting a diffusion model with an image. This method decouples the cross-attention layers of the image and text features. The image features are generated from an image encoder.

<Tip>

Learn how to load an IP-Adapter checkpoint and image in the IP-Adapter [loading](../../using-diffusers/loading_adapters#ip-adapter) guide, and you can see how to use it in the [usage](../../using-diffusers/ip_adapter) guide.
