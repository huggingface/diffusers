# Pipelines

The [`DiffusionPipeline`] is the easiest way to load any pretrained diffusion pipeline from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers) and use it for inference.

<Tip>
	
You shouldn't use the [`DiffusionPipeline`] class for training or finetuning a diffusion model. Individual 
components (for example, [`UNetModel`] and [`UNetConditionModel`]) of diffusion pipelines are usually trained individually, so we suggest directly working with instead.

</Tip>

The pipeline type (for example [`StableDiffusionPipeline`]) of any diffusion pipeline loaded with [`~DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained`] is automatically 
detected and pipeline components are loaded and passed to the `__init__` function of the pipeline.

Any pipeline object can be saved locally with [`~DiffusionPipeline.save_pretrained`].
