# Semantic Guidance

Semantic Guidance for Diffusion Models was proposed in [SEGA: Instructing Text-to-Image Models using Semantic Guidance](https://huggingface.co/papers/2301.12247) and provides strong semantic control over image generation.
Small changes to the text prompt usually result in entirely different output images. However, with SEGA a variety of changes to the image are enabled that can be controlled easily and intuitively, while staying true to the original image composition.

The abstract from the paper is:

*Text-to-image diffusion models have recently received a lot of interest for their astonishing ability to produce high-fidelity images from text only. However, achieving one-shot generation that aligns with the user's intent is nearly impossible, yet small changes to the input prompt often result in very different images. This leaves the user with little semantic control. To put the user in control, we show how to interact with the diffusion process to flexibly steer it along semantic directions. This semantic guidance (SEGA) generalizes to any generative architecture using classifier-free guidance. More importantly, it allows for subtle and extensive edits, changes in composition and style, as well as optimizing the overall artistic conception. We demonstrate SEGA's effectiveness on both latent and pixel-based diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, Paella, and DeepFloyd-IF using a variety of tasks, thus providing strong evidence for its versatility, flexibility, and improvements over existing methods.*

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
