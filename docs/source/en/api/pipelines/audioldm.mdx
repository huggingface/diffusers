# AudioLDM

## Overview

AudioLDM was proposed in [AudioLDM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12503) by Haohe Liu et al.

Inspired by [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/overview), AudioLDM
is a text-to-audio _latent diffusion model (LDM)_ that learns continuous audio representations from [CLAP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/clap)
latents. AudioLDM takes a text prompt as input and predicts the corresponding audio. It can generate text-conditional
sound effects, human speech and music.

This pipeline was contributed by [sanchit-gandhi](https://huggingface.co/sanchit-gandhi). The original codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM).

## Text-to-Audio

The [`AudioLDMPipeline`] can be used to load pre-trained weights from [cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2](https://huggingface.co/cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2) and generate text-conditional audio outputs:

```python
from diffusers import AudioLDMPipeline
import torch
import scipy

repo_id = "cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2"
pipe = AudioLDMPipeline.from_pretrained(repo_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "Techno music with a strong, upbeat tempo and high melodic riffs"
audio = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=10, audio_length_in_s=5.0).audios[0]

# save the audio sample as a .wav file
scipy.io.wavfile.write("techno.wav", rate=16000, data=audio)
```

### Tips

Prompts:
* Descriptive prompt inputs work best: you can use adjectives to describe the sound (e.g. "high quality" or "clear") and make the prompt context specific (e.g., "water stream in a forest" instead of "stream").
* It's best to use general terms like 'cat' or 'dog' instead of specific names or abstract objects that the model may not be familiar with.

Inference:
* The _quality_ of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by the `num_inference_steps` argument: higher steps give higher quality audio at the expense of slower inference.
* The _length_ of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by varying the `audio_length_in_s` argument.

### How to load and use different schedulers

The AudioLDM pipeline uses [`DDIMScheduler`] scheduler by default. But `diffusers` provides many other schedulers
that can be used with the AudioLDM pipeline such as [`PNDMScheduler`], [`LMSDiscreteScheduler`], [`EulerDiscreteScheduler`],
[`EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler`] etc. We recommend using the [`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`] as it's currently the fastest
scheduler there is.

To use a different scheduler, you can either change it via the [`ConfigMixin.from_config`]
method, or pass the `scheduler` argument to the `from_pretrained` method of the pipeline. For example, to use the
[`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`], you can do the following:

```python
>>> from diffusers import AudioLDMPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
>>> import torch

>>> pipeline = AudioLDMPipeline.from_pretrained("cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
>>> pipeline.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipeline.scheduler.config)

>>> # or
>>> dpm_scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_pretrained("cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2", subfolder="scheduler")
>>> pipeline = AudioLDMPipeline.from_pretrained(
...     "cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2", scheduler=dpm_scheduler, torch_dtype=torch.float16
... )
```
