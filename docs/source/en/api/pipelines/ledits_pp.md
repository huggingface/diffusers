LEDITS++ was proposed in [LEDITS++: Limitless Image Editing using Text-to-Image Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.16711) by Manuel Brack, Felix Friedrich, Katharina Kornmeier, Linoy Tsaban, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting, Apolin√°rio Passos.

The abstract from the paper is:

*Text-to-image diffusion models have recently received increasing interest for their astonishing ability to produce high-fidelity images from solely text inputs. Subsequent research efforts aim to exploit and apply their capabilities to real image editing. However, existing image-to-image methods are often inefficient, imprecise, and of limited versatility. They either require time-consuming fine-tuning, deviate unnecessarily strongly from the input image, and/or lack support for multiple, simultaneous edits. To address these issues, we introduce LEDITS++, an efficient yet versatile and precise textual image manipulation technique. LEDITS++'s novel inversion approach requires no tuning nor optimization and produces high-fidelity results with a few diffusion steps. Second, our methodology supports multiple simultaneous edits and is architecture-agnostic. Third, we use a novel implicit masking technique that limits changes to relevant image regions. We propose the novel TEdBench++ benchmark as part of our exhaustive evaluation. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of LEDITS++ and its improvements over previous methods.

<Tip>

You can find additional information about LEDITS++ on the [project page](https://leditsplusplus-project.static.hf.space/index.html) and try it out in a [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/editing-images/leditsplusplus).

</Tip>

<Tip warning={true}>
Due to some backward compatability issues with the current diffusers implementation of [`~schedulers.DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`] this implementation of LEdits++ can no longer guarantee perfect inversion.
This issue is unlikely to have any noticeable effects on applied use-cases. However, we provide an alternative implementation that guarantees perfect inversion in a dedicated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ml-research/ledits_pp).

We provide two distinct pipelines based on different pre-trained models.
