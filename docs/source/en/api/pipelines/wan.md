# Wan

[Wan-2.1](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20314) by the Wan Team.

*This report presents Wan, a comprehensive and open suite of video foundation models designed to push the boundaries of video generation. Built upon the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, Wan achieves significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations, including our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data curation, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively enhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is characterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan, trained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos, demonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and model size. It consistently outperforms the existing open-source models as well as state-of-the-art commercial solutions across multiple internal and external benchmarks, demonstrating a clear and significant performance superiority. Comprehensiveness: Wan offers two capable models, i.e., 1.3B and 14B parameters, for efficiency and effectiveness respectively. It also covers multiple downstream applications, including image-to-video, instruction-guided video editing, and personal video generation, encompassing up to eight tasks. Consumer-Grade Efficiency: The 1.3B model demonstrates exceptional resource efficiency, requiring only 8.19 GB VRAM, making it compatible with a wide range of consumer-grade GPUs. Openness: We open-source the entire series of Wan, including source code and all models, with the goal of fostering the growth of the video generation community. This openness seeks to significantly expand the creative possibilities of video production in the industry and provide academia with high-quality video foundation models. All the code and models are available at [this https URL](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1).*

### Any-to-Video Controllable Generation

Wan VACE supports various generation techniques which achieve controllable video generation. Some of the capabilities include:
- Control to Video (Depth, Pose, Sketch, Flow, Grayscale, Scribble, Layout, Boundary Box, etc.). Recommended library for preprocessing videos to obtain control videos: [huggingface/controlnet_aux]()
- Image/Video to Video (first frame, last frame, starting clip, ending clip, random clips)
- Inpainting and Outpainting
- Subject to Video (faces, object, characters, etc.)
- Composition to Video (reference anything, animate anything, swap anything, expand anything, move anything, etc.)

The code snippets available in [this](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/11582) pull request demonstrate some examples of how videos can be generated with controllability signals.

The general rule of thumb to keep in mind when preparing inputs for the VACE pipeline is that the input images, or frames of a video that you want to use for conditioning, should have a corresponding mask that is black in color. The black mask signifies that the model will not generate new content for that area, and only use those parts for conditioning the generation process. For parts/frames that should be generated by the model, the mask should be white in color.

### Wan-Animate: Unified Character Animation and Replacement with Holistic Replication

[Wan-Animate](https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.14055) by the Wan Team.

*We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos. Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.*

The project page: https://humanaigc.github.io/wan-animate

This model was contributed by [M. Tolga Cangöz](https://github.com/tolgacangoz).

#### Usage

The Wan-Animate pipeline supports two modes of operation:

1. **Animation Mode** (default): Animates a character image based on motion and expression from reference videos
2. **Replacement Mode**: Replaces a character in a background video with a new character while preserving the scene

##### Prerequisites

Before using the pipeline, you need to preprocess your reference video to extract:
- **Pose video**: Contains skeletal keypoints representing body motion
- **Face video**: Contains facial feature representations for expression control

For replacement mode, you additionally need:
- **Background video**: The original video containing the scene
- **Mask video**: A mask indicating where to generate content (white) vs. preserve original (black)

> [!NOTE]
> The preprocessing tools are available in the original Wan-Animate repository. Integration of these preprocessing steps into Diffusers is planned for a future release.

The example below demonstrates how to use the Wan-Animate pipeline:

#### Key Parameters

- **mode**: Choose between `"animation"` (default) or `"replacement"`

- **guidance_scale**: Controls how closely the output follows the text prompt. Higher values (5-7) produce results more aligned with the prompt
- **num_frames**: Total number of frames to generate. Should be divisible by `vae_scale_factor_temporal` (default: 4)

- Set the [`AutoencoderKLWan`] dtype to `torch.float32` for better decoding quality.

- The number of frames per second (fps) or `k` should be calculated by `4 * k + 1`.

- Try lower `shift` values (`2.0` to `5.0`) for lower resolution videos and higher `shift` values (`7.0` to `12.0`) for higher resolution images.

- Wan 2.1 and 2.2 support using [LightX2V LoRAs](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy/tree/main/Lightx2v) to speed up inference. Using them on Wan 2.2 is slightly more involed. Refer to [this code snippet](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/12040#issuecomment-3144185272) to learn more.

- Wan 2.2 has two denoisers. By default, LoRAs are only loaded into the first denoiser. One can set `load_into_transformer_2=True` to load LoRAs into the second denoiser. Refer to [this](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/12074#issue-3292620048) and [this](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/12074#issuecomment-3155896144) examples to learn more.
