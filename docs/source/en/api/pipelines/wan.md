# Wan2.1

[Wan-2.1](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20314) by the Wan Team.

*This report presents Wan, a comprehensive and open suite of video foundation models designed to push the boundaries of video generation. Built upon the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, Wan achieves significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations, including our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data curation, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively enhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is characterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan, trained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos, demonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and model size. It consistently outperforms the existing open-source models as well as state-of-the-art commercial solutions across multiple internal and external benchmarks, demonstrating a clear and significant performance superiority. Comprehensiveness: Wan offers two capable models, i.e., 1.3B and 14B parameters, for efficiency and effectiveness respectively. It also covers multiple downstream applications, including image-to-video, instruction-guided video editing, and personal video generation, encompassing up to eight tasks. Consumer-Grade Efficiency: The 1.3B model demonstrates exceptional resource efficiency, requiring only 8.19 GB VRAM, making it compatible with a wide range of consumer-grade GPUs. Openness: We open-source the entire series of Wan, including source code and all models, with the goal of fostering the growth of the video generation community. This openness seeks to significantly expand the creative possibilities of video production in the industry and provide academia with high-quality video foundation models. All the code and models are available at [this https URL](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1).*

### First-Last-Frame-to-Video Generation

### Any-to-Video Controllable Generation

Wan VACE supports various generation techniques which achieve controllable video generation. Some of the capabilities include:
- Control to Video (Depth, Pose, Sketch, Flow, Grayscale, Scribble, Layout, Boundary Box, etc.). Recommended library for preprocessing videos to obtain control videos: [huggingface/controlnet_aux]()
- Image/Video to Video (first frame, last frame, starting clip, ending clip, random clips)
- Inpainting and Outpainting
- Subject to Video (faces, object, characters, etc.)
- Composition to Video (reference anything, animate anything, swap anything, expand anything, move anything, etc.)

The code snippets available in [this](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/11582) pull request demonstrate some examples of how videos can be generated with controllability signals.

The general rule of thumb to keep in mind when preparing inputs for the VACE pipeline is that the input images, or frames of a video that you want to use for conditioning, should have a corresponding mask that is black in color. The black mask signifies that the model will not generate new content for that area, and only use those parts for conditioning the generation process. For parts/frames that should be generated by the model, the mask should be white in color.

- Set the [`AutoencoderKLWan`] dtype to `torch.float32` for better decoding quality.

- The number of frames per second (fps) or `k` should be calculated by `4 * k + 1`.

- Try lower `shift` values (`2.0` to `5.0`) for lower resolution videos and higher `shift` values (`7.0` to `12.0`) for higher resolution images.
