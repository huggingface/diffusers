# Text-to-Image Generation

## FabricPipeline

FABRIC is training-free approach that conditions the diffusion process on a set of feedback images, applicable to a wide range of popular diffusion models, created by the researchers and engineers from [ETH Zürich, Switzerland](https://github.com/sd-fabric). The [`FabricPipeline`] is capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input using Stable Diffusion and finetune them on the basis of feedback.

The original codebase can be found here: 
- *Stable Diffusion V1*: [sd-fabric/fabric](https://github.com/sd-fabric/fabric)

Available Checkpoints are:
- *dreamlike-photoreal-2.0 (512x512 resolution)* [dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0](https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0)
