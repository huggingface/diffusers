# CogVideoX

[CogVideoX](https://huggingface.co/papers/2408.06072) is a large diffusion transformer model - available in 2B and 5B parameters - designed to generate longer and more consistent videos from text. This model uses a 3D causal variational autoencoder to more efficiently process video data by reducing sequence length (and associated training compute) and preventing flickering in generated videos. An "expert" transformer with adaptive LayerNorm improves alignment between text and video, and 3D full attention helps accurately capture motion and time in generated videos.

You can find all the original CogVideoX checkpoints under the [CogVideoX](https://huggingface.co/collections/THUDM/cogvideo-66c08e62f1685a3ade464cce) collection.

> [!TIP]
> Click on the CogVideoX models in the right sidebar for more examples of other video generation tasks.

The example below demonstrates how to generate a video optimized for memory or inference speed.

<hfoption id="memory">

Refer to the [Reduce memory usage](../../optimization/memory) guide for more details about the various memory saving techniques.

The quantized CogVideoX 5B model below requires ~16GB of VRAM.

<hfoption id="inference speed">

[Compilation](../../optimization/fp16#torchcompile) is slow the first time but subsequent calls to the pipeline are faster.

The average inference time with torch.compile on a 80GB A100 is 76.27 seconds compared to 96.89 seconds for an uncompiled model.

import torch
from diffusers import CogVideoXPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

## Notes

- CogVideoX supports LoRAs with [`~loaders.CogVideoXLoraLoaderMixin.load_lora_weights`].

  </details>

- The text-to-video (T2V) checkpoints work best with a resolution of 1360x768 because that was the resolution it was pretrained on.

- The image-to-video (I2V) checkpoints work with multiple resolutions. The width can vary from 768 to 1360, but the height must be 758. Both height and width must be divisible by 16.

- Both T2V and I2V checkpoints work best with 81 and 161 frames. It is recommended to export the generated video at 16fps.

- Refer to the table below to view memory usage when various memory-saving techniques are enabled.

  | method | memory usage (enabled) | memory usage (disabled) |
  |---|---|---|
  | enable_model_cpu_offload | 19GB | 33GB |
  | enable_sequential_cpu_offload | <4GB | ~33GB (very slow inference speed) |
  | enable_tiling | 11GB (with enable_model_cpu_offload) | --- |
