[ModelScope Text-to-Video Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06571) is by Jiuniu Wang, Hangjie Yuan, Dayou Chen, Yingya Zhang, Xiang Wang, Shiwei Zhang.

The abstract from the paper is:

*This paper introduces ModelScopeT2V, a text-to-video synthesis model that evolves from a text-to-image synthesis model (i.e., Stable Diffusion). ModelScopeT2V incorporates spatio-temporal blocks to ensure consistent frame generation and smooth movement transitions. The model could adapt to varying frame numbers during training and inference, rendering it suitable for both image-text and video-text datasets. ModelScopeT2V brings together three components (i.e., VQGAN, a text encoder, and a denoising UNet), totally comprising 1.7 billion parameters, in which 0.5 billion parameters are dedicated to temporal capabilities. The model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across three evaluation metrics. The code and an online demo are available at https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/text-to-video-synthesis/summary.*

You can find additional information about Text-to-Video on the [project page](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/text-to-video-synthesis/summary), [original codebase](https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope/), and try it out in a [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/damo-vilab/modelscope-text-to-video-synthesis).

## Usage example

### `text-to-video-ms-1.7b`

Let's start by generating a short video with the default length of 16 frames (2s at 8 fps):

```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16")
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "Spiderman is surfing"
video_frames = pipe(prompt).frames[0]
video_path = export_to_video(video_frames)
video_path
```

Diffusers supports different optimization techniques to improve the latency
and memory footprint of a pipeline. Since videos are often more memory-heavy than images,
we can enable CPU offloading and VAE slicing to keep the memory footprint at bay.

Let's generate a video of 8 seconds (64 frames) on the same GPU using CPU offloading and VAE slicing:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16")
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

# memory optimization
pipe.enable_vae_slicing()

prompt = "Darth Vader surfing a wave"
video_frames = pipe(prompt, num_frames=64).frames[0]
video_path = export_to_video(video_frames)
video_path
```

It just takes **7 GBs of GPU memory** to generate the 64 video frames using PyTorch 2.0, "fp16" precision and the techniques mentioned above.

We can also use a different scheduler easily, using the same method we'd use for Stable Diffusion:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16")
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

prompt = "Spiderman is surfing"
video_frames = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=25).frames[0]
video_path = export_to_video(video_frames)
video_path
```

Here are some sample outputs:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><center>
        An astronaut riding a horse.
        <br>
        <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/astr.gif"
            alt="An astronaut riding a horse."
            style="width: 300px;" />
        </center></td>
        <td ><center>
        Darth vader surfing in waves.
        <br>
        <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/vader.gif"
            alt="Darth vader surfing in waves."
            style="width: 300px;" />
        </center></td>
    </tr>
</table>

### `cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w` & `cerspense/zeroscope_v2_XL`

Zeroscope are watermark-free model and have been trained on specific sizes such as `576x320` and `1024x576`.
One should first generate a video using the lower resolution checkpoint [`cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w`](https://huggingface.co/cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w) with [`TextToVideoSDPipeline`],
which can then be upscaled using [`VideoToVideoSDPipeline`] and [`cerspense/zeroscope_v2_XL`](https://huggingface.co/cerspense/zeroscope_v2_XL).


```py
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video
from PIL import Image

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

# memory optimization
pipe.unet.enable_forward_chunking(chunk_size=1, dim=1)
pipe.enable_vae_slicing()

prompt = "Darth Vader surfing a wave"
video_frames = pipe(prompt, num_frames=24).frames[0]
video_path = export_to_video(video_frames)
video_path
```

Now the video can be upscaled:

```py
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("cerspense/zeroscope_v2_XL", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

# memory optimization
pipe.unet.enable_forward_chunking(chunk_size=1, dim=1)
pipe.enable_vae_slicing()

video = [Image.fromarray(frame).resize((1024, 576)) for frame in video_frames]

video_frames = pipe(prompt, video=video, strength=0.6).frames[0]
video_path = export_to_video(video_frames)
video_path
```

Here are some sample outputs:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td ><center>
        Darth vader surfing in waves.
        <br>
        <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/darthvader_cerpense.gif"
            alt="Darth vader surfing in waves."
            style="width: 576px;" />
        </center></td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Tips

Video generation is memory-intensive and one way to reduce your memory usage is to set `enable_forward_chunking` on the pipeline's UNet so you don't run the entire feedforward layer at once. Breaking it up into chunks in a loop is more efficient.

Check out the [Text or image-to-video](text-img2vid) guide for more details about how certain parameters can affect video generation and how to optimize inference by reducing memory usage.

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
