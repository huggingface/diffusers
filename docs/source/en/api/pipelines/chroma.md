Chroma is a text to image generation model based on Flux.

Original model checkpoints for Chroma can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma).

<Tip>

Chroma can use all the same optimizations as Flux.

## Inference

The Diffusers version of Chroma is based on the [`unlocked-v37`](https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma/blob/main/chroma-unlocked-v37.safetensors) version of the original model, which is available in the [Chroma repository](https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma).

```python
import torch
from diffusers import ChromaPipeline

pipe = ChromaPipeline.from_pretrained("lodestones/Chroma", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

prompt = [
    "A high-fashion close-up portrait of a blonde woman in clear sunglasses. The image uses a bold teal and red color split for dramatic lighting. The background is a simple teal-green. The photo is sharp and well-composed, and is designed for viewing with anaglyph 3D glasses for optimal effect. It looks professionally done."
]
negative_prompt =  ["low quality, ugly, unfinished, out of focus, deformed, disfigure, blurry, smudged, restricted palette, flat colors"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(433),
    num_inference_steps=40,
    guidance_scale=3.0,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
).images[0]
image.save("chroma.png")
```

## Loading from a single file

To use updated model checkpoints that are not in the Diffusers format, you can use the `ChromaTransformer2DModel` class to load the model from a single file in the original format. This is also useful when trying to load finetunes or quantized versions of the models that have been published by the community.

The following example demonstrates how to run Chroma from a single file.

Then run the following example

```python
import torch
from diffusers import ChromaTransformer2DModel, ChromaPipeline

model_id = "lodestones/Chroma"
dtype = torch.bfloat16

transformer = ChromaTransformer2DModel.from_single_file("https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma/blob/main/chroma-unlocked-v37.safetensors", torch_dtype=dtype)

pipe = ChromaPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, transformer=transformer, torch_dtype=dtype)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

prompt = [
    "A high-fashion close-up portrait of a blonde woman in clear sunglasses. The image uses a bold teal and red color split for dramatic lighting. The background is a simple teal-green. The photo is sharp and well-composed, and is designed for viewing with anaglyph 3D glasses for optimal effect. It looks professionally done."
]
negative_prompt =  ["low quality, ugly, unfinished, out of focus, deformed, disfigure, blurry, smudged, restricted palette, flat colors"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(433),
    num_inference_steps=40,
    guidance_scale=3.0,
).images[0]

image.save("chroma-single-file.png")
```
