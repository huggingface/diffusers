# ControlNet-XS

ControlNet-XS was introduced in [ControlNet-XS](https://vislearn.github.io/ControlNet-XS/) by Denis Zavadski and Carsten Rother. It is based on the observation that the control model in the [original ControlNet](https://huggingface.co/papers/2302.05543) can be made much smaller and still produce good results.

Like the original ControlNet model, you can provide an additional control image to condition and control Stable Diffusion generation. For example, if you provide a depth map, the ControlNet model generates an image that'll preserve the spatial information from the depth map. It is a more flexible and accurate way to control the image generation process.

ControlNet-XS generates images with comparable quality to a regular ControlNet, but it is 20-25% faster ([see benchmark](https://github.com/UmerHA/controlnet-xs-benchmark/blob/main/Speed%20Benchmark.ipynb) with StableDiffusion-XL) and uses ~45% less memory.

Here's the overview from the [project page](https://vislearn.github.io/ControlNet-XS/):

*With increasing computing capabilities, current model architectures appear to follow the trend of simply upscaling all components without validating the necessity for doing so. In this project we investigate the size and architectural design of ControlNet [Zhang et al., 2023] for controlling the image generation process with stable diffusion-based models. We show that a new architecture with as little as 1% of the parameters of the base model achieves state-of-the art results, considerably better than ControlNet in terms of FID score. Hence we call it ControlNet-XS. We provide the code for controlling StableDiffusion-XL [Podell et al., 2023] (Model B, 48M Parameters) and StableDiffusion 2.1 [Rombach et al. 2022] (Model B, 14M Parameters), all under openrail license.*

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
