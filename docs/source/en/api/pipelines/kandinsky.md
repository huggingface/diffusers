# Kandinsky 2.1

Kandinsky 2.1 is created by [Arseniy Shakhmatov](https://github.com/cene555), [Anton Razzhigaev](https://github.com/razzant), [Aleksandr Nikolich](https://github.com/AlexWortega), [Vladimir Arkhipkin](https://github.com/oriBetelgeuse), [Igor Pavlov](https://github.com/boomb0om), [Andrey Kuznetsov](https://github.com/kuznetsoffandrey), and [Denis Dimitrov](https://github.com/denndimitrov).

The description from it's GitHub page is:

*Kandinsky 2.1 inherits best practicies from Dall-E 2 and Latent diffusion, while introducing some new ideas. As text and image encoder it uses CLIP model and diffusion image prior (mapping) between latent spaces of CLIP modalities. This approach increases the visual performance of the model and unveils new horizons in blending images and text-guided image manipulation.*

The original codebase can be found at [ai-forever/Kandinsky-2](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2).

<Tip>

Check out the [Kandinsky Community](https://huggingface.co/kandinsky-community) organization on the Hub for the official model checkpoints for tasks like text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting.

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
