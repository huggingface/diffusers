# ControlNet with Stable Diffusion XL

ControlNet was introduced in [Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2302.05543) by Lvmin Zhang, Anyi Rao, and Maneesh Agrawala.

With a ControlNet model, you can provide an additional control image to condition and control Stable Diffusion generation. For example, if you provide a depth map, the ControlNet model generates an image that'll preserve the spatial information from the depth map. It is a more flexible and accurate way to control the image generation process.

The abstract from the paper is:

*We present ControlNet, a neural network architecture to add spatial conditioning controls to large, pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. ControlNet locks the production-ready large diffusion models, and reuses their deep and robust encoding layers pretrained with billions of images as a strong backbone to learn a diverse set of conditional controls. The neural architecture is connected with "zero convolutions" (zero-initialized convolution layers) that progressively grow the parameters from zero and ensure that no harmful noise could affect the finetuning. We test various conditioning controls, eg, edges, depth, segmentation, human pose, etc, with Stable Diffusion, using single or multiple conditions, with or without prompts. We show that the training of ControlNets is robust with small (<50k) and large (>1m) datasets. Extensive results show that ControlNet may facilitate wider applications to control image diffusion models.*

You can find additional smaller Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) ControlNet checkpoints from the ðŸ¤— [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/diffusers) Hub organization, and browse [community-trained](https://huggingface.co/models?other=stable-diffusion-xl&other=controlnet) checkpoints on the Hub.

<Tip warning={true}>

ðŸ§ª Many of the SDXL ControlNet checkpoints are experimental, and there is a lot of room for improvement. Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose) and leave us feedback on how we can improve!

</Tip>

If you don't see a checkpoint you're interested in, you can train your own SDXL ControlNet with our [training script](../../../../../examples/controlnet/README_sdxl).

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
