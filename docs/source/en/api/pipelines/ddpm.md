# DDPM

[Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2006.11239) (DDPM) by Jonathan Ho, Ajay Jain and Pieter Abbeel proposes a diffusion based model of the same name. In the ðŸ¤— Diffusers library, DDPM refers to the *discrete denoising scheduler* from the paper as well as the pipeline.

The abstract from the paper is:

*We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN.*

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
