# FluxControlInpaint

FluxControlInpaintPipeline is an implementation of Inpainting for Flux.1 Depth/Canny models. It is a pipeline that allows you to inpaint images using the Flux.1 Depth/Canny models. The pipeline takes an image and a mask as input and returns the inpainted image.

FLUX.1 Depth and Canny [dev] is a 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer capable of generating an image based on a text description while following the structure of a given input image. **This is not a ControlNet model**.

| Control type | Developer | Link |
| -------- | ---------- | ---- |
| Depth | [Black Forest Labs](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Depth-dev) |
| Canny | [Black Forest Labs](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Canny-dev) |


<Tip>

Flux can be quite expensive to run on consumer hardware devices. However, you can perform a suite of optimizations to run it faster and in a more memory-friendly manner. Check out [this section](https://huggingface.co/blog/sd3#memory-optimizations-for-sd3) for more details. Additionally, Flux can benefit from quantization for memory efficiency with a trade-off in inference latency. Refer to [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/quanto-diffusers) to learn more. For an exhaustive list of resources, check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/sayakpaul/b664605caf0aa3bf8585ab109dd5ac9c).
