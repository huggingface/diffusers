# Dance Diffusion

[Dance Diffusion](https://github.com/Harmonai-org/sample-generator) is by Zach Evans.

Dance Diffusion is the first in a suite of generative audio tools for producers and musicians released by [Harmonai](https://github.com/Harmonai-org).


<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
