# Allegro

[Allegro: Open the Black Box of Commercial-Level Video Generation Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15458) from RhymesAI, by Yuan Zhou, Qiuyue Wang, Yuxuan Cai, Huan Yang.

The abstract from the paper is:

*Significant advancements have been made in the field of video generation, with the open-source community contributing a wealth of research papers and tools for training high-quality models. However, despite these efforts, the available information and resources remain insufficient for achieving commercial-level performance. In this report, we open the black box and introduce Allegro, an advanced video generation model that excels in both quality and temporal consistency. We also highlight the current limitations in the field and present a comprehensive methodology for training high-performance, commercial-level video generation models, addressing key aspects such as data, model architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation. Our user study shows that Allegro surpasses existing open-source models and most commercial models, ranking just behind Hailuo and Kling.

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.

## Quantization

Quantization helps reduce the memory requirements of very large models by storing model weights in a lower precision data type. However, quantization may have varying impact on video quality depending on the video model.

Refer to the [Quantization](../../quantization/overview) overview to learn more about supported quantization backends and selecting a quantization backend that supports your use case. The example below demonstrates how to load a quantized [`AllegroPipeline`] for inference with bitsandbytes.

```py
import torch
from diffusers import BitsAndBytesConfig as DiffusersBitsAndBytesConfig, AllegroTransformer3DModel, AllegroPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig as BitsAndBytesConfig, T5EncoderModel

quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
text_encoder_8bit = T5EncoderModel.from_pretrained(
    "rhymes-ai/Allegro",
    subfolder="text_encoder",
    quantization_config=quant_config,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
)

quant_config = DiffusersBitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
transformer_8bit = AllegroTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained(
    "rhymes-ai/Allegro",
    subfolder="transformer",
    quantization_config=quant_config,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
)

pipeline = AllegroPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "rhymes-ai/Allegro",
    text_encoder=text_encoder_8bit,
    transformer=transformer_8bit,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="balanced",
)

prompt = (
    "A seaside harbor with bright sunlight and sparkling seawater, with many boats in the water. From an aerial view, "
    "the boats vary in size and color, some moving and some stationary. Fishing boats in the water suggest that this "
    "location might be a popular spot for docking fishing boats."
)
video = pipeline(prompt, guidance_scale=7.5, max_sequence_length=512).frames[0]
export_to_video(video, "harbor.mp4", fps=15)
```
