# SDXL Turbo

Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) Turbo was proposed in [Adversarial Diffusion Distillation](https://stability.ai/research/adversarial-diffusion-distillation) by Axel Sauer, Dominik Lorenz, Andreas Blattmann, and Robin Rombach.

The abstract from the paper is:

*We introduce Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), a novel training approach that efficiently samples large-scale foundational image diffusion models in just 1â€“4 steps while maintaining high image quality. We use score distillation to leverage large-scale off-the-shelf image diffusion models as a teacher signal in combination with an adversarial loss to ensure high image fidelity even in the low-step regime of one or two sampling steps. Our analyses show that our model clearly outperforms existing few-step methods (GANs,Latent Consistency Models) in a single step and reaches the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models (SDXL) in only four steps. ADD is the first method to unlock single-step, real-time image synthesis with foundation models.*

## Tips

- SDXL Turbo uses the exact same architecture as [SDXL](./stable_diffusion_xl), which means it also has the same API. Please refer to the [SDXL](./stable_diffusion_xl) API reference for more details.
- SDXL Turbo should disable guidance scale by setting `guidance_scale=0.0`.
- SDXL Turbo should use `timestep_spacing='trailing'` for the scheduler and use between 1 and 4 steps.
- SDXL Turbo has been trained to generate images of size 512x512.
- SDXL Turbo is open-access, but not open-source meaning that one might have to buy a model license in order to use it for commercial applications. Make sure to read the [official model card](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo) to learn more.
