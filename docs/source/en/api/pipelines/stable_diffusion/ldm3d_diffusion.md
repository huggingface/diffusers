LDM3D was proposed in [LDM3D: Latent Diffusion Model for 3D](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.10853) by Gabriela Ben Melech Stan, Diana Wofk, Scottie Fox, Alex Redden, Will Saxton, Jean Yu, Estelle Aflalo, Shao-Yen Tseng, Fabio Nonato, Matthias Muller, and Vasudev Lal. LDM3D generates an image and a depth map from a given text prompt unlike the existing text-to-image diffusion models such as [Stable Diffusion](./overview) which only generates an image. With almost the same number of parameters, LDM3D achieves to create a latent space that can compress both the RGB images and the depth maps.

Two checkpoints are available for use:
- [ldm3d-original](https://huggingface.co/Intel/ldm3d). The original checkpoint used in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10853.pdf)
- [ldm3d-4c](https://huggingface.co/Intel/ldm3d-4c). The new version of LDM3D using 4 channels inputs instead of 6-channels inputs and finetuned on higher resolution images.


The abstract from the paper is:

*This research paper proposes a Latent Diffusion Model for 3D (LDM3D) that generates both image and depth map data from a given text prompt, allowing users to generate RGBD images from text prompts. The LDM3D model is fine-tuned on a dataset of tuples containing an RGB image, depth map and caption, and validated through extensive experiments. We also develop an application called DepthFusion, which uses the generated RGB images and depth maps to create immersive and interactive 360-degree-view experiences using TouchDesigner. This technology has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from entertainment and gaming to architecture and design. Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of generative AI and computer vision, and showcases the potential of LDM3D and DepthFusion to revolutionize content creation and digital experiences.

# Upscaler

[LDM3D-VR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03226.pdf) is an extended version of LDM3D.

The abstract from the paper is:
*Latent diffusion models have proven to be state-of-the-art in the creation and manipulation of visual outputs. However, as far as we know, the generation of depth maps jointly with RGB is still limited. We introduce LDM3D-VR, a suite of diffusion models targeting virtual reality development that includes LDM3D-pano and LDM3D-SR. These models enable the generation of panoramic RGBD based on textual prompts and the upscaling of low-resolution inputs to high-resolution RGBD, respectively. Our models are fine-tuned from existing pretrained models on datasets containing panoramic/high-resolution RGB images, depth maps and captions. Both models are evaluated in comparison to existing related methods*

Two checkpoints are available for use:
- [ldm3d-pano](https://huggingface.co/Intel/ldm3d-pano). This checkpoint enables the generation of panoramic images and requires the StableDiffusionLDM3DPipeline pipeline to be used.
- [ldm3d-sr](https://huggingface.co/Intel/ldm3d-sr). This checkpoint enables the upscaling of RGB and depth images. Can be used in cascade after the original LDM3D pipeline using the StableDiffusionUpscaleLDM3DPipeline from communauty pipeline.
