# Depth-to-image

<div class="flex flex-wrap space-x-1">

The Stable Diffusion model can also infer depth based on an image using [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS). This allows you to pass a text prompt and an initial image to condition the generation of new images as well as a `depth_map` to preserve the image structure.

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Stable Diffusion [Tips](overview#tips) section to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and how to reuse pipeline components efficiently!

If you're interested in using one of the official checkpoints for a task, explore the [CompVis](https://huggingface.co/CompVis), [Runway](https://huggingface.co/runwayml), and [Stability AI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai) Hub organizations!
