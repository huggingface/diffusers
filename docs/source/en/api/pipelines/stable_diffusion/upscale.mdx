# Super Resolution

The Stable Diffusion upscaler diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It is used to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4.

The original codebase can be found at [Stability-AI/stablediffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion#image-upscaling-with-stable-diffusion) and additional official checkpoints for super resolution can be found at [stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler).
