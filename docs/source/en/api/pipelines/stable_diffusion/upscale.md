The Stable Diffusion upscaler diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It is used to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4.

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Stable Diffusion [Tips](overview#tips) section to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and how to reuse pipeline components efficiently!

If you're interested in using one of the official checkpoints for a task, explore the [CompVis](https://huggingface.co/CompVis), [Runway](https://huggingface.co/runwayml), and [Stability AI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai) Hub organizations!
