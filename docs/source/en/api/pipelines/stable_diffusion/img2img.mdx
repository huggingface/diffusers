# Image-to-Image Generation

## StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline

The Stable Diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), [runway](https://github.com/runwayml), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). The [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`] lets you pass a text prompt and an initial image to condition the generation of new images using Stable Diffusion.

The original codebase can be found here: [CampVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/blob/main/scripts/img2img.py) 

[`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`] is compatible with all Stable Diffusion checkpoints for [Text-to-Image](./text2img) 

The pipeline uses the diffusion-denoising mechanism proposed by SDEdit ([SDEdit: Guided Image Synthesis and Editing with Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073)
proposed by Chenlin Meng, Yutong He, Yang Song, Jiaming Song, Jiajun Wu, Jun-Yan Zhu, Stefano Ermon).
