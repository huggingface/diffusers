# Consistency Decoder

Consistency decoder can be used to decode the latents from the denoising UNet in the [`StableDiffusionPipeline`]. This decoder was introduced in the [DALL-E 3 technical report](https://openai.com/dall-e-3).

The original codebase can be found at [openai/consistencydecoder](https://github.com/openai/consistencydecoder).

<Tip warning={true}>

Inference is only supported for 2 iterations as of now.

</Tip>

The pipeline could not have been contributed without the help of [madebyollin](https://github.com/madebyollin) and [mrsteyk](https://github.com/mrsteyk) from [this issue](https://github.com/openai/consistencydecoder/issues/1).
