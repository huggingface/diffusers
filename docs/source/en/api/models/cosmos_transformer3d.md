# CosmosTransformer3DModel

A Diffusion Transformer model for 3D video-like data was introduced in [Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform for Physical AI](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.03575) by NVIDIA.

The model can be loaded with the following code snippet.

```python
from diffusers import CosmosTransformer3DModel

transformer = CosmosTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained("nvidia/Cosmos-1.0-Diffusion-7B-Text2World", subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
```
