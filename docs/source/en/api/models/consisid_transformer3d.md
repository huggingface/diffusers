# ConsisIDTransformer3DModel

A Diffusion Transformer model for 3D data from [ConsisID](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID) was introduced in [Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation by Frequency Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17440) by Peking University & University of Rochester & etc.

The model can be loaded with the following code snippet.

```python
from diffusers import ConsisIDTransformer3DModel

transformer = ConsisIDTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained("BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview", subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to("cuda")
```
