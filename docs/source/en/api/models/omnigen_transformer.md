# OmniGenTransformer2DModel

A Transformer model that accepts multimodal instructions to generate images for [OmniGen](https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen/).

The abstract from the paper is:

*The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unified language  generation tasks and revolutionized human-machine interaction.  However, in the realm of image generation, a unified model capable of handling various tasks within a single framework remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce OmniGen, a new diffusion model for unified image generation. OmniGen is characterized by the following features: 1) Unification: OmniGen not only demonstrates text-to-image generation capabilities but also inherently supports various downstream tasks, such as image editing, subject-driven generation, and visual conditional generation. 2) Simplicity: The architecture of OmniGen is highly simplified, eliminating the need for additional plugins. Moreover, compared to existing diffusion models, it is more user-friendly and can complete complex tasks end-to-end through instructions without the need for extra intermediate steps, greatly simplifying the image generation workflow. 3) Knowledge Transfer: Benefit from learning in a unified format, OmniGen effectively transfers knowledge across different tasks, manages unseen tasks and domains, and exhibits novel capabilities. We also explore the modelâ€™s reasoning capabilities and potential applications of the chain-of-thought mechanism.  This work represents the first attempt at a general-purpose image generation model,  and we will release our resources at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen to foster future advancements.*
