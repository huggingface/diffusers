# UNetMotionModel

The [UNet](https://huggingface.co/papers/1505.04597) model was originally introduced by Ronneberger et al for biomedical image segmentation, but it is also commonly used in ðŸ¤— Diffusers because it outputs images that are the same size as the input. It is one of the most important components of a diffusion system because it facilitates the actual diffusion process. There are several variants of the UNet model in ðŸ¤— Diffusers, depending on it's number of dimensions and whether it is a conditional model or not. This is a 2D UNet model.

The abstract from the paper is:

*There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.*
