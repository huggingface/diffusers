# AutoencoderKLWan

The 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) model with KL loss used in [Wan 2.1](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1) by the Alibaba Wan Team.

The model can be loaded with the following code snippet.

```python
from diffusers import AutoencoderKLWan

vae = AutoencoderKLWan.from_pretrained("Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers", subfolder="vae", torch_dtype=torch.float32)
```
