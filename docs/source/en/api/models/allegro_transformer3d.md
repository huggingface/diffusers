# AllegroTransformer3DModel

A Diffusion Transformer model for 3D data from [Allegro](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Allegro) was introduced in [Allegro: Open the Black Box of Commercial-Level Video Generation Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15458) by RhymesAI.

The model can be loaded with the following code snippet.

```python
from diffusers import AllegroTransformer3DModel

transformer = AllegroTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained("rhymes-ai/Allegro", subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to("cuda")
```
