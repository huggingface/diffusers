# CogView3PlusTransformer2DModel

A Diffusion Transformer model for 2D data from [CogView3Plus](https://github.com/THUDM/CogView3) was introduced in [CogView3: Finer and Faster Text-to-Image Generation via Relay Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.05121) by Tsinghua University & ZhipuAI.

The model can be loaded with the following code snippet.

```python
from diffusers import CogView3PlusTransformer2DModel

transformer = CogView3PlusTransformer2DModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/CogView3Plus-3b", subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to("cuda")
```
