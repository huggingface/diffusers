# CogVideoXTransformer3DModel

A Diffusion Transformer model for 3D data from [CogVideoX](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo) was introduced in [CogVideoX: Text-to-Video Diffusion Models with An Expert Transformer](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo/blob/main/resources/CogVideoX.pdf) by Tsinghua University & ZhipuAI.

The model can be loaded with the following code snippet.

```python
from diffusers import CogVideoXTransformer3DModel

transformer = CogVideoXTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/CogVideoX-2b", subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")
```
