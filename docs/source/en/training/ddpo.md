# Reinforcement learning training with DDPO

You can fine-tune Stable Diffusion on a reward function via reinforcement learning with the ðŸ¤— TRL library and ðŸ¤— Diffusers. This is done with the Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) algorithm introduced by Black et al. in [Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.13301), which is implemented in ðŸ¤— TRL with the [`~trl.DDPOTrainer`].

For more information, check out the [`~trl.DDPOTrainer`] API reference and the [Finetune Stable Diffusion Models with DDPO via TRL](https://huggingface.co/blog/trl-ddpo) blog post.
