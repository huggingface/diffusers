# BaseOutputs

All models have outputs that are instances of subclasses of [`~utils.BaseOutput`]. Those are
data structures containing all the information returned by the model, but that can also be used as tuples or
dictionaries.

Let's see how this looks in an example:

```python
from diffusers import DDIMPipeline

pipeline = DDIMPipeline.from_pretrained("google/ddpm-cifar10-32")
outputs = pipeline()
```

The `outputs` object is a [`~pipeline_utils.ImagePipelineOutput`], as we can see in the
documentation of that class below, it means it has an image attribute.

You can access each attribute as you would usually do, and if that attribute has not been returned by the model, you will get `None`:

```python
outputs.images
```

or via keyword lookup

```python
outputs["images"]
```

When considering our `outputs` object as tuple, it only considers the attributes that don't have `None` values.
Here for instance, we could retrieve images via indexing:

```python
outputs[:1]
```

which will return the tuple `(outputs.images)` for instance.
