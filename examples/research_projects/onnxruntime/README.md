## Diffusers examples with ONNXRuntime optimizations

**This research project is not actively maintained by the diffusers team. For any questions or comments, please contact Prathik Rao (prathikr), Sunghoon Choi (hanbitmyths), Ashwini Khade (askhade), or Peng Wang (pengwa) on github with any questions.**

This aims to provide diffusers examples with ONNXRuntime optimizations for training/fine-tuning unconditional image generation, text to image, and textual inversion. Please see individual directories for more details on how to run each task using ONNXRuntime.
