# T2I-Adapter training example for Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)

The `train_t2i_adapter_sdxl.py` script shows how to implement the [T2I-Adapter training procedure](https://hf.co/papers/2302.08453) for [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952).

## Running locally with PyTorch

### Installing the dependencies

Before running the scripts, make sure to install the library's training dependencies:

**Important**

To make sure you can successfully run the latest versions of the example scripts, we highly recommend **installing from source** and keeping the install up to date as we update the example scripts frequently and install some example-specific requirements. To do this, execute the following steps in a new virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
```

Then cd in the `examples/t2i_adapter` folder and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And initialize an [ðŸ¤—Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/) environment with:

```bash
accelerate config
```

Or for a default accelerate configuration without answering questions about your environment

```bash
accelerate config default
```

Or if your environment doesn't support an interactive shell (e.g., a notebook)

```python
from accelerate.utils import write_basic_config
write_basic_config()
```

When running `accelerate config`, if we specify torch compile mode to True there can be dramatic speedups.

## Circle filling dataset

The original dataset is hosted in the [ControlNet repo](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet/blob/main/training/fill50k.zip). We re-uploaded it to be compatible with `datasets` [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fusing/fill50k). Note that `datasets` handles dataloading within the training script.

## Training

Our training examples use two test conditioning images. They can be downloaded by running

```sh
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/controlnet_training/conditioning_image_1.png

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/controlnet_training/conditioning_image_2.png
```

Then run `huggingface-cli login` to log into your Hugging Face account. This is needed to be able to push the trained T2IAdapter parameters to Hugging Face Hub.

```bash
export MODEL_DIR="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
export OUTPUT_DIR="path to save model"

accelerate launch train_t2i_adapter_sdxl.py \
 --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_DIR \
 --output_dir=$OUTPUT_DIR \
 --dataset_name=fusing/fill50k \
 --trust_remote_code \
 --mixed_precision="fp16" \
 --resolution=1024 \
 --learning_rate=1e-5 \
 --max_train_steps=15000 \
 --validation_image "./conditioning_image_1.png" "./conditioning_image_2.png" \
 --validation_prompt "red circle with blue background" "cyan circle with brown floral background" \
 --validation_steps=100 \
 --train_batch_size=1 \
 --gradient_accumulation_steps=4 \
 --report_to="wandb" \
 --seed=42 \
 --push_to_hub
```

To better track our training experiments, we're using the following flags in the command above:

* `report_to="wandb` will ensure the training runs are tracked on Weights and Biases. To use it, be sure to install `wandb` with `pip install wandb`.
* `validation_image`, `validation_prompt`, and `validation_steps` to allow the script to do a few validation inference runs. This allows us to qualitatively check if the training is progressing as expected.

Our experiments were conducted on a single 40GB A100 GPU.

### Inference

Once training is done, we can perform inference like so:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLAdapterPipeline, T2IAdapter, EulerAncestralDiscreteSchedulerTest
from diffusers.utils import load_image
import torch

base_model_path = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
adapter_path = "path to adapter"

adapter = T2IAdapter.from_pretrained(adapter_path, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = StableDiffusionXLAdapterPipeline.from_pretrained(
    base_model_path, adapter=adapter, torch_dtype=torch.float16
)

# speed up diffusion process with faster scheduler and memory optimization
pipe.scheduler = EulerAncestralDiscreteSchedulerTest.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
# remove following line if xformers is not installed or when using Torch 2.0.
pipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()
# memory optimization.
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

control_image = load_image("./conditioning_image_1.png")
prompt = "pale golden rod circle with old lace background"

# generate image
generator = torch.manual_seed(0)
image = pipe(
    prompt, num_inference_steps=20, generator=generator, image=control_image
).images[0]
image.save("./output.png")
```

## Notes

### Specifying a better VAE

SDXL's VAE is known to suffer from numerical instability issues. This is why we also expose a CLI argument namely `--pretrained_vae_model_name_or_path` that lets you specify the location of a better VAE (such as [this one](https://huggingface.co/madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix)).
