# DreamBooth training example for SANA

[DreamBooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242) is a method to personalize text2image models like stable diffusion given just a few (3~5) images of a subject.

The `train_dreambooth_lora_sana.py` script shows how to implement the training procedure with [LoRA](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/adapter#low-rank-adaptation-lora) and adapt it for [SANA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10629). 


This will also allow us to push the trained model parameters to the Hugging Face Hub platform.

## Running locally with PyTorch

### Installing the dependencies

Before running the scripts, make sure to install the library's training dependencies:

**Important**

To make sure you can successfully run the latest versions of the example scripts, we highly recommend **installing from source** and keeping the install up to date as we update the example scripts frequently and install some example-specific requirements. To do this, execute the following steps in a new virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
```

Then cd in the `examples/dreambooth` folder and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements_sana.txt
```

And initialize an [ðŸ¤—Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/) environment with:

```bash
accelerate config
```

Or for a default accelerate configuration without answering questions about your environment

```bash
accelerate config default
```

Or if your environment doesn't support an interactive shell (e.g., a notebook)

```python
from accelerate.utils import write_basic_config
write_basic_config()
```

When running `accelerate config`, if we specify torch compile mode to True there can be dramatic speedups.
Note also that we use PEFT library as backend for LoRA training, make sure to have `peft>=0.14.0` installed in your environment.


### Dog toy example

Now let's get our dataset. For this example we will use some dog images: https://huggingface.co/datasets/diffusers/dog-example.

Let's first download it locally:

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

local_dir = "./dog"
snapshot_download(
    "diffusers/dog-example",
    local_dir=local_dir, repo_type="dataset",
    ignore_patterns=".gitattributes",
)
```

This will also allow us to push the trained LoRA parameters to the Hugging Face Hub platform.

Now, we can launch training using:

```bash
export MODEL_NAME="Efficient-Large-Model/Sana_1600M_1024px_BF16_diffusers"
export INSTANCE_DIR="dog"
export OUTPUT_DIR="trained-sana-lora"

accelerate launch train_dreambooth_lora_sana.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_NAME  \
  --instance_data_dir=$INSTANCE_DIR \
  --output_dir=$OUTPUT_DIR \
  --mixed_precision="bf16" \
  --instance_prompt="a photo of sks dog" \
  --resolution=1024 \
  --train_batch_size=1 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps=4 \
  --use_8bit_adam \
  --learning_rate=1e-4 \
  --report_to="wandb" \
  --lr_scheduler="constant" \
  --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
  --max_train_steps=500 \
  --validation_prompt="A photo of sks dog in a bucket" \
  --validation_epochs=25 \
  --seed="0" \
  --push_to_hub
```

For using `push_to_hub`, make you're logged into your Hugging Face account:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

To better track our training experiments, we're using the following flags in the command above:

* `report_to="wandb` will ensure the training runs are tracked on [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site). To use it, be sure to install `wandb` with `pip install wandb`. Don't forget to call `wandb login <your_api_key>` before training if you haven't done it before.
* `validation_prompt` and `validation_epochs` to allow the script to do a few validation inference runs. This allows us to qualitatively check if the training is progressing as expected.

## Notes

Additionally, we welcome you to explore the following CLI arguments:

* `--lora_layers`: The transformer modules to apply LoRA training on. Please specify the layers in a comma seperated. E.g. - "to_k,to_q,to_v" will result in lora training of attention layers only.
* `--complex_human_instruction`: Instructions for complex human attention as shown in [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/Sana/blob/main/configs/sana_app_config/Sana_1600M_app.yaml#L55).
* `--max_sequence_length`: Maximum sequence length to use for text embeddings.


We provide several options for optimizing memory optimization:

* `--offload`: When enabled, we will offload the text encoder and VAE to CPU, when they are not used.
* `cache_latents`: When enabled, we will pre-compute the latents from the input images with the VAE and remove the VAE from memory once done.
* `--use_8bit_adam`: When enabled, we will use the 8bit version of AdamW provided by the `bitsandbytes` library.

Refer to the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/sana) of the `SanaPipeline` to know more about the models available under the SANA family and their preferred dtypes during inference.
