        Instantiate a PyTorch diffusion pipeline from pre-trained pipeline weights.

        The pipeline is set in evaluation mode by default using `model.eval()` (Dropout modules are deactivated).

        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *repo id* of a pretrained pipeline hosted inside a model repo on
                      https://huggingface.co/ Valid repo ids have to be located under a user or organization name, like
                      `CompVis/ldm-text2im-large-256`.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing pipeline weights saved using
                      [`~DiffusionPipeline.save_pretrained`], e.g., `./my_pipeline_directory/`.
            torch_dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
                Override the default `torch.dtype` and load the model under this dtype. If `"auto"` is passed the dtype
                will be automatically derived from the model's weights.
            custom_pipeline (`str`, *optional*):

                <Tip warning={true}>

                    This is an experimental feature and is likely to change in the future.

                </Tip>

                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *repo id* of a custom pipeline hosted inside a model repo on
                      https://huggingface.co/. Valid repo ids have to be located under a user or organization name,
                      like `hf-internal-testing/diffusers-dummy-pipeline`.

                        <Tip>

                         It is required that the model repo has a file, called `pipeline.py` that defines the custom
                         pipeline.

                        </Tip>

                    - A string, the *file name* of a community pipeline hosted on GitHub under
                      https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community. Valid file names have to
                      match exactly the file name without `.py` located under the above link, *e.g.*
                      `clip_guided_stable_diffusion`.

                        <Tip>

                         Community pipelines are always loaded from the current `main` branch of GitHub.

                        </Tip>

                    - A path to a *directory* containing a custom pipeline, e.g., `./my_pipeline_directory/`.

                        <Tip>

                         It is required that the directory has a file, called `pipeline.py` that defines the custom
                         pipeline.

            torch_dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):

                cached versions if they exist.
            resume_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to delete incompletely received files. Will attempt to resume the download if such a
                file exists.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            use_auth_token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, will use the token generated
                when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.
            custom_revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"` when loading from the Hub and to local version of `diffusers` when loading from GitHub):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id similar to
                `revision` when loading a custom pipeline from the Hub. It can be a diffusers version when loading a
                custom pipeline from GitHub.
            mirror (`str`, *optional*):
                Mirror source to accelerate downloads in China. If you are from China and have an accessibility
                problem, you can set this option to resolve it. Note that we do not guarantee the timeliness or safety.
                Please refer to the mirror site for more information. specify the folder name here.
            device_map (`str` or `Dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device]]`, *optional*):
                A map that specifies where each submodule should go. It doesn't need to be refined to each
                parameter/buffer name, once a given module name is inside, every submodule of it will be sent to the
                same device.

                To have Accelerate compute the most optimized `device_map` automatically, set `device_map="auto"`. For
                more information about each option see [designing a device
                map](https://hf.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map).
            low_cpu_mem_usage (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True` if torch version >= 1.9.0 else `False`):
                Speed up model loading by not initializing the weights and only loading the pre-trained weights. This
                also tries to not use more than 1x model size in CPU memory (including peak memory) while loading the
                model. This is only supported when torch version >= 1.9.0. If you are using an older version of torch,
                setting this argument to `True` will raise an error.
            return_cached_folder (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                If set to `True`, path to downloaded cached folder will be returned in addition to loaded pipeline.
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to overwrite load - and saveable variables - *i.e.* the pipeline components - of the
                specific pipeline class. The overwritten components are then directly passed to the pipelines
                `__init__` method. See example below for more information.

        <Tip>

         It is required to be logged in (`huggingface-cli login`) when you want to use private or [gated
         models](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-gated#gated-models), *e.g.* `"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"`

        Enable memory efficient attention as implemented in xformers.

        When this option is enabled, you should observe lower GPU memory usage and a potential speed up at inference
        time. Speed up at training time is not guaranteed.

        Warning: When Memory Efficient Attention and Sliced attention are both enabled, the Memory Efficient Attention
        is used.

        Parameters:
            attention_op (`Callable`, *optional*):
                Override the default `None` operator for use as `op` argument to the
